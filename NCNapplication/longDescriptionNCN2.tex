\section{Scientific goal}\label{scientific-goal}}

As many miscarriages of justice indicate, scientific evidence is easily
misinterpreted in court. This happens partially due to miscommunication
between the parties involved, partially due to the usual probabilistic
fallacies, but also because incorporating scientific evidence in the
context of a whole case can be really hard. While probabilistic tools
for piecemeal evaluation of scientific evidence and spotting
probablistic fallacies in legal contexts are quite well
developed,\todo{say sth about replicability crisis in forensic sciences at some point?}
the construction of a more general probabilistic model of incorporating
such evidence in a wider context of a whole case, probabilistic
explication of and theorizing about evidence evaluation and legal
decision standards, remain a challenge. Legal probabilism (LP), for our
purpose, is the view that this challenge can and should be met. This
project intends to contribute to further development of this enterprise
in a philosophically motivated manner.

The assessment of evidence in the court of law can be viewed from at
least three perspectives: as an interplay of arguments, as an assessment
of probabilities involved, or as an interaction of competing narrations.
Each perspective presents an account of legal reasoning (Di Bello \&
Verheij, 2018; van Eemeren \& Verheij, 2017). Individually, each of
these strains has been investigated. The probablistic approach is the
most developed one but LP is still underdeveloped ---to a large extent
this is so in light of various lines of criticism developed by the
representatives of the other strains.

The \textbf{goal of this project} is to contribute to the
\textbf{development of legal probabilism} by formulating its variant
that accomodates important \textbf{insights provided by its critics}. A
crucial point of criticism is that the fact-finding process should be
conceptualized as \textbf{a competition of narrations}. I plan to
develop methods that allow the probabilist to take this perspective, and
explain how such methods allow the legal probabilist to address various
objections present in the literature. The key idea is that once
\textbf{narrations are represented as bayesian networks, various criteria on,  features of  and operations on narrations can be explicated in terms of corresponding properties of and operations on bayesian networks}.
Further, the hypothesis is that such an improved framework will
facilitate addressing key objections raised against LP.

The conceptual developments will be accompanied by technical accounts.
\textbf{\textsf{R}} code capturing the technical features developed will
be made available to the reader. Thus, the output will be a
\textbf{unifying extended probabilistic model embracing key aspects of the narrative and argumentative approaches, susceptible to AI implementation.}
The methods employed include: Bayesian statistical methods (including
Bayesian approach to higher-order probability), imprecise probabilities,
and Bayesian networks.

\subsection{State of the art}\label{state-of-the-art}}

One of the functions of the trial is to resolve disputes about questions
of facts. Did the defendant rob the bank? Who is the father of the
child? Did this drug cause birth defects? To answer such questions, the
litigants will present evidence of different kinds: eyewitness
testimonies, DNA matches, epidemiological studies, etc. The evidence
presented will often be in conflict with other evidence. In a bank
robbery case, for example, the prosecution may present eyewitness
testimony that the defendant was seen driving a truck near the bank a
few minutes after the robbery took place. The defense may respond that
no traces were found at the crime scene that would match the defendant.
The fact-finders, judges or lay jurors, should address these conflicts
by assessing and weighing the evidence, and on that basis reach a final
decision. This is a difficult task. The evidence presented at trial can
be complex and open to multiple interpretations, and even when it is
assessed carefully, it may still lead to an incorrect verdict. How
should judges and jurors respond to this uncertainty?

From among the three perspectives mentioned in the beginning, the
probablistic approach will be my point of departure, for the following
key reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The project is to be informed by and reflect on the actual practice of
  legal evidence evaluation, and much of scientific evidence in such
  contexts has probabilistic form.
\item
  Probabilistic tools are fairly well-developed both for applications
  and within formal epistemology, reaching a state of fruition which
  should inspire deeper reflection.
\item
  Statistical computing tools for such methods are available, which
  makes programming development and preliminary computational and
  data-driven evaluation of the ideas to be defended a viable
  enterprise.
\end{itemize}

Accoringly, the view in focus of this research is legal probabilism
(LP)---an ongoing research program that comprises a variety of claims
about evidence assessment and decision-making at trial. At its simplest,
it comprises two core tenets: first, that the evidence presented at
trial can be assessed, weighed and combined by means of probability
theory; and second, that legal decision rules, such as proof beyond a
reasonable doubt in criminal cases, can be explicated in probabilistic
terms.

In the Middle Ages, before the advent of probability theory, there
existed an informal mathematics of legal evidence (Wigmore, 1901).
Formalistic procedures fixed the number of witnesses required to
establish a claim. Lawyers would list ways in which items of evidence
could be added or subtracted to weaken or strengthen one's case. This
formalistic system fell into disrepute as the Enlightenment principle of
`free proof' gained wide acceptance (Damaška, 1995). Concurrently, the
development of probability theory brought forth a new approach to
weighing evidence and making decisions under uncertainty. The early
theorists of probability in the 17th and 18th century were as much
interested in games of chance as they were interested in the uncertainty
of trial decisions (Daston, 1988; Franklin, 2001; Hacking, 1975).
Bernoulli (1713) was one of the first to formulate probabilistic rules
for combining different pieces of evidence in legal cases and assessing
to what extent they supported a claim of interest. He was also one of
the first to suggest that decision rules at trial could be understood as
probability thresholds.

Bernoulli's prescient insights attained greater popularity in the 20th
century amidst the law and economics movement (Becker, 1968; Calabresi,
1961; Posner, 1973). In a seminal article, Finkelstein \& Fairley (1970)
gave one of the first systematic analyses of how probability theory, and
Bayes' theorem in particular, can help to weigh evidence at trial.
Lempert (1977) was one of the first to rely on probability theory,
specifically likelihood ratios, for assessing the relevance of evidence.
Such contributions fueled what has been called the New Evidence
Scholarship, a rigorous way of studying the process of legal proof at
trial (Lempert, 1986).

In response to such developments, Tribe (1971) attacked what he called
`trial by mathematics'. His critique ranged from listing well-known
cases of misuse or probabilities in legal contexts and practical
difficulties in assessing the probability of someone's criminal or civil
liability to the dehumanization of trial decisions. After Tribe, many
have criticized legal probabilism on a variety of grounds, both
theoretical and practical, arguing that probabilistic models are either
inadequate or unhelpful (Brilmayer, 1986; Dant, 1988, pp.
@Allen1986A--Reconceptuali; Underwood, 1977, p. cohen86).

After the discovery of DNA fingerprinting in the eighties, many legal
probabilists focused on how probability theory could be used to quantify
the strength of a DNA match under various circumstances (Kaye, 1986,
2010; Koehler, 1996; National Research Council, 1992; Robertson \&
Vignaux, 1995).

Some legal scholars and practitioners have voiced their support for
legal probabilism explicitly (Tillers \& Gottfried, 2007). Yet
skepticism about mathematical and quantitative models of legal evidence
is still widespread among prominent legal scholars and practitioners
(see, for example, Allen \& Pardo, 2007). Even among legal probabilists,
few would think it possible to quantify precisely the probability of
someone's guilt or civil liability. In response, Taroni, Biedermann,
Bozza, Garbolino, \& Aitken (2014) suggest that the probabilistic
formalism `should primarily be considered as an aid to structure and
guide one's inferences under uncertainty, rather than a way to reach
precise numerical assessments' (p.~xv).

Perhaps the most difficult callenge challenge for legal probabilism---at
least, one that has galvanized philosophical attention in recent
years---comes from the paradoxes of legal proof or puzzles of naked
statistical evidence. In a number of seminal papers, (Cohen, 1981;
Nesson, 1979; Thomson, 1986) formulated scenarios in which, even if the
probability of guilt or civil liability, based on the available
evidence, is particularly high, a verdict against the defendant seems
unwarranted.

Imagine you are a trier of fact in a legal proceeding in which the
defendant's guilt is identified as equivalent to a certain factual
statement \(G\) and that somehow you succeeded in properly evaluating
\(\pr{G\vert E}\)----the probability of \(G\) given the total evidence
presented to you, \(E\) One question that arises in such a situation is:
when should you decide against the defendant? when is the evidence good
enough? What we are after here is a condition \(\Psi\), formulated in
(primarily) probabilistic terms, such that the trier of fact, at least
ideally, should accept any relevant claim \(A\) (including \(G\)) just
in case \(\Psi(A, E)\). One straightforward attempt might be to say:
convict if \(\pr{G\vert E}\) is above a certain threshold, otherwise
acquit.

The difficulty about conjunction arises because intuitively there should
be no difference betweenthe trier's acceptance of \(A\) and \(B\)
separately, and her acceptance of their conjunction, \(A\wedge B\) ,
that is, that \(\Psi(A,E)\) and \(\Psi(B,E)\) just in case
\(\Psi(A\ wedge B, E)\). If \(\Psi(H,E)\) just the threshold criterion,
requiring that \(\pr(H\vert E)\) be sufficiently high, \(\Psi\) in
general fails to satisfy this equivalence.

A variant of the gatecrasher paradox goes as follows. suppose our guilt
threshold is high, say at 0.99. Consider the situationin which 1000 fans
enter a football stadium, and 991 of them avoidpaying for their tickets.
A random spectator is tried for not paying. The probability that the
spectator under trial did not pay exceeds 0.99. Yet,intuitively, a
spectator cannot be considered liable on the sole basis of the number of
people who did and did not pay.

Arguably, these scenarios underscore a theoretical difficulty with
probabilistic accounts of legal standards of proof. Many articles have
been written on the topic, initially by legal scholars. In the last
decade, philosophers have also joined the debate, while interest among
legal scholars has waned.\footnote{For critical surveys see (Gardiner,
  2018; Redmayne, 2008; pardo2019; Urbaniak, 2019).} Other conceptual
challenges for legal probabilism include the so-called problem of
conjunction and the reference class problem.

One important difficulty is that there are various thought experiments
in which the probability of guilt is very high and yet conviction or
finding of liability is intuitively unjustified---these are known as
proof paradoxes (Cohen, 1977; Redmayne, 2008). \todo{Add an example}

At least \emph{prima facie}, then, it seems that some conditions other
than high posterior probability of liability have to be satisfied for
the decision to penalize (or find liable) to be justified. Accordingly,
various informal notions have been claimed to be essential for a proper
explication of judiciary decision standards (Haack, 2014; Wells, 1992).
For instance, evidence is claimed to be insufficient for conviction if
it is not \emph{sensitive} to the issue at hand: if it remained the same
even if the accused was innocent (Enoch \& Fisher, 2015). Or, to look at
another approach, evidence is claimed to be insufficient for conviction
if it doesn't \emph{normically support} it: if---given the same
evidence---no explanation would be needed even if the accused was
innocent (Smith, 2017). A legal probabilist needs either to show that
these notions are unnecessary or inadequate for the purpose at hand, or
to indicate how they can be explicated in probabilistic terms.

More recently, alternative frameworks for modeling evidential reasoning
and decision-making at trial have been proposed. They are based on
inference to the best explanation (Allen, 2010; Pardo \& Allen, 2008),
narratives and stories (Allen, 1986, 2010; Allen \& Leiter, 2001;
Clermont, 2015; Pardo, 2018; Pennington \& Hastie, 1991a), and
argumentation theory (Bex, 2011; Gordon, Prakken, \& Walton, 2007;
Walton, 2002). Those who favor a conciliatory stance have combined legal
probabilism with other frameworks, offering preliminary sketches of
hybrid theories (Verheij, 2014, p. @urbaniak2018narration).

Another important point of criticism of LP is that legal proceedings are
back-and-forth between opposing parties in which cross-examination is of
crucial importance, reasoning goes not only evidence-to-hypothesis, but
also hypotheses-to-evidence (Allen \& Pardo, 2007; Wells, 1992) in a way
that seems analogous to inference to the best explanation (Dant, 1988),
which notoriously is claimed to not be susceptible to probabilistic
analysis (Lipton, 2004). An informal philosophical account inspired by
such considerations---The \textbf{No Plausible Alternative Story (NPAS)}
theory (Allen, 2010)---is that the courtroom is a confrontation of
competing narrations (Ho, 2008; Wagenaar, Van Koppen, \& Crombag, 1993)
offered by the sides, and the narrative to be selected should be the
most plausible one. The view is conceptually plausible (Di Bello, 2013),
and finds support in psychological evidence (Pennington \& Hastie,
1991b, 1992).

It would be a great advantage of legal probabilism if it could model
phenomena captured by the narrative approach. But how is the legal
probabilist to make sense of them? From her perspective, the key
disadvantage of NPAS is that it abandons the rich toolbox of
probabilistic methods and takes the key notion of plausibility to be a
primitive notion which should be understood only intuitively.

\#\# Pioneering nature of the project

Recent work in Artificial Intelligence made it possible to use
probability theory---in the form of Bayesian networks---to weigh and
assess complex bodies of evidence consisting of multiple components.

Initial philosophical analysis of the approach has been performed, (Di
Bello, 2013) pioneering a probabilistic understanding of narrations.
