Package tocbasic Info: omitting babel extension for `toc'
(tocbasic)             because of feature `nobabel' available
(tocbasic)             for `toc' on input line 137.
Package scrartcl Info: You've used standard option `11pt'.
(scrartcl)             This is correct!
(scrartcl)             Internally I'm using `fontsize=11pt'.
(scrartcl)             If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,
(scrartcl)             you'd have to use `fontsize=11pt' there
(scrartcl)             instead of `11pt', too.


Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrartcl)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrartcl)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrartcl)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrartcl)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrartcl)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrartcl)              is not recommended.

I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
