\noindent \Large \textbf{1. Scientific goal} \normalsize

\vspace{1mm}

The \textbf{goal of this project} is to
\textbf{develop  a probabilistic  modelling method of handling the multiplicity of evidence,  hypotheses and theories of what happened, and the resulting decisions in the court of law}.
In light of the current criticism of the probabilistic approach to such
issues, such a method should (1) be
\textbf{sensitive to the argumentative structure} involved, and (2)
capture the idea that in a legal context we are dealing with a
\textbf{class of competing narrations}.

The point of departure is to represent narrations as bayesian networks
enriched with additional layer of information as to which nodes
correspond to evidence, and which are binary narration nodes.
\textbf{The key idea is that with such bayesian networks as building material, various features requested by the critics (such as coherence, resiliency, missing evidence,  explaining evidence, or ways to handle a multiplicity of proposed narrations) can be explicated in terms of corresponding properties of,  operations on, and relations between bayesian networks.}

The output will be a
\textbf{unifying extended probabilistic model embracing key aspects of the narrative and argumentative approaches, with  implementation in the programming language \textbf{\textsf{R}}.}
What the project will uniquely bring to the table is joining the
familiarity with epistemological debates, familiarity with the details
of evidence assessment in legal cases and technical skill to
programmatically implement, simulate and test various theoretical moves.

\normalsize 

\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Legal probabilism (LP)} comprises two core tenets: (1) the
evidence presented at trial can be assessed, weighed and combined by
means of probability theory; and (2) legal decision rules, such as proof
beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, can be explicated in
probabilistic terms. LP gained popularity amidst the law and economics
movement (Becker, 1968; Calabresi, 1961; Finkelstein \& Fairley, 1970;
Lempert, 1977, 1986; Posner, 1973). These developments faced
\textbf{criticism} (Allen, 1986; Brilmayer, 1986; Cohen, 1986; Dant,
1988; Tribe, 1971; Underwood, 1977). The negative trend has been
somewhat mitigated by the discovery of DNA fingerprinting in the
eighties and progress in forensic science in general, with the
increasing role of quantitative evidence in the court of law (Kaye,
1986, 2010; Koehler, 1996; National Research Council, 1992; Robertson \&
Vignaux, 1995).

Skepticism about wider mathematical and quantitative models of legal
evidence is still widespread among prominent legal scholars and
practitioners, partially in light of \textbf{conceptual difficulties}
extensively discussed in the literature, which arise when one wants to
formulate a probabilistic decision criterion for the court of law (Allen
\& Pardo, 2007). For instance, the threshold view has it that
sufficiently high probability of guilt is sufficient for conviction
(Dekay, 1996; Kaye, 1979; Laudan, 2006). The threshold view is blocked
by the so-called paradoxes of legal proof or puzzles of naked
statistical evidence (Cohen, 1981; Nesson, 1979; Thomson, 1986). Another
conceptual problem is the so-called difficulty about conjunction. It
arises, because intuitively there should be no difference between the
trier's acceptance of \(A\) and \(B\) separately, and her acceptance of
their conjunction, \(A\wedge B\). On the threshold view, such a
difference might arise.

How to define the \textbf{standards of proof}, or whether they should be
even defined in the first place, remains contentious (Diamond, 1990;
Gardiner, 2018; Horowitz \& Kirkpatrick, 1996; Laudan, 2006; Newman,
1993; Redmayne, 2008; Walen, 2015). Various informal notions have been
claimed to be essential for a proper explication of judiciary decision
standards (Enoch \& Fisher, 2015; Haack, 2014; Smith, 2017; Wells,
1992). A legal probabilist needs either to show that these notions are
unnecessary or inadequate for the purpose at hand, or to indicate how
they can be explicated in probabilistic terms.

\textbf{Alternative frameworks} for modeling evidential reasoning and
decision-making at trial have been proposed. They are based on inference
to the best explanation (Allen, 2010; Hastie, 2019; Ho, 2019; Nance,
2019; Pardo \& Allen, 2008; Schwartz \& Sober, 2019), narratives and
stories (Allen, 1986, 2010; Allen \& Leiter, 2001; Clermont, 2015;
Pardo, 2018; Pennington \& Hastie, 1991a), and argumentation theory
(Bex, 2011; Gordon, Prakken, \& Walton, 2007; Walton, 2002). Preliminary
sketches of hybrid theories (Urbaniak, 2018a; Verheij, 2014) are also
available.

The main point of criticism of LP raised by the alternative approaches
is that legal proceedings are back-and-forth between opposing parties in
which cross-examination and the argumentative structure are of crucial
importance, reasoning goes not only evidence-to-hypothesis, but also
hypotheses-to-evidence in a way that seems analogous to inference to the
best explanation, which notoriously is claimed to not be susceptible to
probabilistic analysis (Allen \& Pardo, 2007; Dant, 1988; Lipton, 2004;
Wells, 1992).

An informal philosophical account inspired by such considerations---The
\textbf{No Plausible Alternative Story (NPAS)} theory---is that the
courtroom is a confrontation of competing narrations offered by the
sides, and the narrative to be selected should be the most plausible one
(Allen, 2010; Ho, 2008; Wagenaar, Van Koppen, \& Crombag, 1993). The
view is conceptually plausible (Di Bello, 2013), and finds support in
psychological evidence (Pennington \& Hastie, 1991b, 1992). It would be
a great advantage of LP if it could model such phenomena and by doing so
resolve the already mentioned conceptual challenges.

The idea that \textbf{Bayesian networks} can be used for probabilistic
reasoning in legal fact-finding started gaining traction in late
eighties and early nineties (Edwards, 1991). A Bayesian network
comprises two components: a directed acyclic graph of relations of
dependence (represented by arrows) between variables (represented by
nodes) and conditional probability tables corresponding to these
relations. Fairly simple graphical patterns (called \emph{idioms}) often
appear while modeling the relationships between evidence and hypotheses.
Complex graphical models can be constructed by combining these basic
patters in a modular way (Bovens \& Hartmann, 2004; Fenton \& Neil,
2018a; Fenton, Neil, \& Lagnado, 2013; Friedman, 1974; Hepler, Dawid, \&
Leucari, 2007; Neil, Fenton, \& Nielson, 2000; Taroni, Biedermann,
Bozza, Garbolino, \& Aitken, 2014).

Some attempts have been made to use Bayesian networks to weigh and
assess complex bodies of evidence consisting of multiple components.
Kadane \& Schum (2011) made one the first attempts to model an
\textbf{entire criminal case}, Sacco \& Vanzetti from 1920, using
probabilistic graphs. Similarly, Fenton \& Neil (2018b) constructed a
Bayesian network for the famous Sally Clark case. The literature
contains also a general approach the use of BNs for modeling whole
cases. The main idea is that once all the pieces of evidence and claims
are represented as nodes, one should use the \textbf{scenario idiom} to
model complex hypotheses, consisting of a sequence of events organized
in space and time: a scenario (Vlek, Prakken, Renooij, \& Verheij,
2014).\footnote{A discussion of modelling crime scenarios by means of
  graphical devices mixed with probabilities can be also found in the
  work of Shen, Keppens, Aitken, Schafer, \& Lee (2007)\}, Bex (2011),
  Bex (2015), Dawid \& Mortera (2018) and Verheij (2017). See also the
  survey by Di Bello \& Verheij (2018).} A BN that uses the scenario
idiom would consist of the following components: first, nodes for the
states and events in the scenario, with each node linked to the
supporting evidence; second, a separate scenario node that has all
states and events as its children; finally, a node corresponding to the
ultimate hypothesis as a child of the scenario node. The scenario node
in a sense unifies the different events and states. Because of this
unifying role, changing the probability of one part of the scenario will
also usually change the probability of the other parts. This is intended
to capture the idea that the different components of a scenario form an
interconnected sequence of events.

This strategy is supposed to make sense of the notion of the
\textbf{coherence of a scenario} as different from its probability given
the evidence. On this approach (Vlek, 2016; Vlek, Prakken, Renooij, \&
Bart Verheij, 2015; Vlek, Prakken, Renooij, \& Verheij, 2013; Vlek et
al., 2014), coherence is identified with the prior probability of the
scenario node. The approach is also supposed to model reasoning multiple
scenarios. Given a class of narrations, all the nodes used in some of
the separate BNs that correspond to them are to be used to build one
large BN, and all separate scenario nodes are to be included in the
final large BN.

An \textbf{alternative approach} to representation of and reasoning with
multiple scenarios has been developed by Neil, Fenton, Lagnado, \& Gill
(2019). They criticize (Urbaniak, 2018a) by pointing out that it makes
no connection to BNs and so it ``fails to offer a convincing and
operational means to structure and compare competing narratives.'' This
is a fair assessment of the limits of what I have achieved so far. They
represent separate narrations in terms of separate BNs, and deploy
bayesian model comparison and averaging (linear pooling) as a tool for
reasoning with multiple scenarios.

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \large \textbf{2.2. Pioneering nature of the project}

\vspace{1mm} \normalsize

Here are the key reasons why I am convinced
\textbf{the scenario node approach is not satisfactory}. (A) Adding a
parent node by \emph{fiat} without any good reasons to think the nodes
are connected other than being a part of a single story, introduces
probabilistic dependencies between the elements of a narration. (B)
Another problem is the identification of prior probability with
coherence. This does not add up intuitively: there are coherent but
unlikely stories. (C) In general, the legal probabilistic approach to
coherence is very simple and fails to engage with rich philosophical
literature exactly on this topic (Douven \& Meijs, 2007; Fitelson,
2003a, 2003b; Glass, 2002; Meijs \& Douven, 2007; Olsson, 2001;
Shogenji, 1999).\footnote{This appraoch also fails to include a long
  list of counterexamples to the existing proposals and desiderata that
  a probabilistic coherence measure should satisfy (Akiba, 2000; Bovens
  \& Hartmann, 2004; Crupi, Tentori, \& Gonzalez, 2007; Koscholke, 2016;
  Merricks, 1995; Schippers \& Koscholke, 2019; Shogenji, 1999, 2001,
  2006; Siebel, 2004, 2006).} (D) The merging procedure with scenario
nodes assumes that for the nodes that are common to the networks to be
merged, both the directions of the arrows in the DAGs and the
conditional probability tables are the same across different narrations.
This is unrealistic.

Here are the key
\textbf{limitations of the model selection and averaging approach}. (E)
The use equal priors is highly debatable. This approach would render
prior probabilities quite sensitive to the choice of hypotheses and thus
potentially arbitrary. Also, this approach seems particularly unsuitable
for criminal cases. If the only two hypotheses/models on the table
ultimately say ``the defendant is guilty'' and ``the defendant is
innocent'', the prior probability of each would be 50\%. But defendants
in criminal cases, however, should be presumed innocent until proven
guilty. A 50\% prior probability of guilt seems excessive.\footnote{Some
  (Williamson, 2010) try to defend a variant of the principle of
  indifference by reference to informational entropy, and a proposal
  along this line has been used in practical recommendation by expert
  committees (ENFSI Expert Working Group Marks Conclusion Scale
  Committee, 2006). However, this attempt has been sensibly criticized
  by Biedermann, Taroni, \& Garbolino (2007). The question remains, what
  should the proper application of informational entropy in the context
  of BN selection and averaging look like, given that information
  entropy considerations independently are in epistemologically decent
  standing?} Some take the presumption to mean that the prior
probability of guilt should be set to a small value (Friedman, 2000;
Friedman, Allen, Balding, Donnelly, \& Kaye, 1995), but it is not clear
whether this interpretation can be justified on epistemological or
decision-theoretic grounds. (F) More recent models rely on relevant
background information about people's opportunities to commit crimes
(Fenton, Lagnado, Dahlman, \& Neil, 2019). But even if these models are
successful in giving well-informed assessments of prior probabilities
any evidence-based assessment of prior probabilities, they are likely to
violate existing normative requirements of the trial system (Dahlman,
2017; Engel, 2012; Schweizer, 2013). People who belong to certain
demographic groups will be regarded as having a higher prior probability
of committing a wrong than others, and this outcome can be seen as
unfair (Di Bello \& O'Neil, 2020). (G) Model selection based on
likelihood (given equal priors) or posterior model probabilities in
general (if priors are not assumed to be equal) boils down to a variant
of the threshold view, and so all the difficulties with the threshold
view apply. (H) There is a rich literature on the difficulties that
linear pooling runs into (see the surveys in Dietrich \& List, 2016;
Franz Dietrich \& List, 2017a, 2017b). One problem is that the method
satisfies the unanimity assumption: whenever all models share a degree
of belief in a claim, this is exactly the output degree for that belief.
Another problem is that linear pooling does not preserve probabilistic
independence (List \& Pettit, 2011): even if all models agree that
certain nodes are independent, they might end up being dependent in the
output. There is also a variety of impossibility theorems in the
neighborhood (Gallow, 2018).

\vspace{2mm}

\noindent \textbf{The key steps in my proposal are as follows}:

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
\textbf{Representation.} Use BNs taken separately without scenario nodes
to represent various narrations. without assuming the conditional
probability tables or directions of edges are the same across the BNs,
adding another layer of information, dividing nodes into evidence and
narration nodes.

\noindent \textbf{Dynamic BNs.} Averaging does not seem to be the right
way to model cross-examination. To take the argumentative approach
seriously and to be able to model relations such as ``undercutting'' and
``rebutting'' I will consider another dimension: BNs changing through
time in light of other BNs.

\noindent
 \textbf{BN-based coherence.} I have formulated a BN-based coherence
measure that is not a function of a probabilistic measure and a set of
propositions alone, because it is also sensitive to the selection and
direction of arrows in a Bayesian Network representing an agent's credal
state. Now, it needs to be deployed (implemented in \textbf{\textsf{R}}
for BNs) and properly tested on real-life cases discussed in the LP
literature.

\noindent
 \textbf{Divide and conquer.} I propose that ensemble methods should be
deployed for multiple narration variants available from one side (as in
when, say, the prosecution story comes with uncertainty about the
direction of an arrow or about a particular probability table), but
selection methods should be used when final decision is to be made
between narrations proposed by the opposing sides.

\noindent
\textbf{Ensemble methods.} One question that arises is whether the
general concerns about linear pooling arise for such limited
applications. If not, the remaining concern is what priors should be
used. In light of the controversial nature of equal priors, I plan to
study the consequences of rescaling coherence scores (already mentioned)
to constitute model priors. The idea is that given that narrations are
to be developed by the sides themselves, taking coherence of their
narration as determining the prior might be more fair than using equal
priors or relying on geographical or population statistics. If yes,
perhaps some other methods boiling down to a variant of sensitivity
analysis can be deployed: look at all BNs corresponding to some variant
of the narration of one of the sides, find the ones that give strongest
(and the weakest) support to the final conclusion, and these give you a
range of possible outcomes.

\noindent
 \textbf{Selection criteria.} The so-called New Legal Probabilism (NLP)
is an attempt to improve on the underspecificity of NPAS (Di Bello,
2013). While still being at most semi-formal, the approach is more
specific about the conditions that a successful accusing narration is to
satisfy for the conviction beyond reasonable doubt to be justified. Di
Bello works out the philosophical details of requirements such as
evidential support and completeness, resiliency, and narrativity. It is
far from obvious that such conditions are susceptible to a Bayesian
networks explication. I plan to rely on a more expressive probabilistic
framework (Urbaniak, 2018b, 2018a), that is capable of expressing such
features within a formalized higher-order language. The key hypothesis
is that they can be recast in terms of properties of BNs and that the
existing BN programming tools can be extended to implement testing for
these criteria. This will make them susceptible to programmatic
implementation and further study by means of computational methods. The
hope is that on one hand, they will do better than the existing
proposals, and where they fail, further insights can be gained by
studying the reasons behind such failures.

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent \Large \textbf{3. Work plan}

\vspace{1mm} \normalsize

Throughout the whole project I plan to cooperate with Marcello Di Bello
(Arizona State University). Over the last year we co-authored the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Legal Probabilism. We
decided to continue our fruitful cooperation. For over two months we
have been working on a book proposal to be submitted to Oxford
University Press exactly on the issues to be studied in this research
project. Marcello Di Bello is an excellent philsopher with extensive
research experience in the philosophy of legal evidence, and he would
bring his expertise to the table when working both on the book and on
the papers, whereas I would be focused on the technical aspects and the
underlying formal philosophy. During the last year of the research
\textbf{I plan a six months' stay at Arizona State University}, to work
in person with Di Bello on finalizing the book that presents the results
of the project.

Apart from publications, the results will be presented at various
conferences devoted to legal reasoning. These include the yearly
conferences of the
\emph{International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law} and
of the \emph{Foundation for Legal Knowledge Based Systems (JURIX)}, and
more general conferences gathering formal philosophers, so that the
research is inspired by interaction not only with legal evidence
scholars, computer scientists, but also philosophers. I am also already
an invited speaker at the upcoming ``Probability and Proof'' conference
that will be part of an international conference on the philosophy of
legal evidence (``The Michele Taruffo Girona Evidence Week'') in Girona
(Spain) May 23-27 2022.

\noindent \Large \textbf{4. Methodology}

\vspace{1mm} \normalsize

Standard arguments for the legitimacy of Bayesianism\footnote{See for
  example (Earman, 1992; Urbach \& Howson, 1993) for an early yet fairly
  comprehensive survey, or (Pettigrew, 2011) for a discussion of more
  recent contributions. See also (Bovens \& Hartmann, 2004; Bradley,
  2015; Swinburne, 2001).} deploy usually rather abstract pieces of
reasoning to the effect that if one's degrees of beliefs satisfy certain
conditions, they also have to satisfy the probabilistic requirements. My
approach to thinking about the plausibility of Bayesian epistemology is
rather unlike such approaches. Instead, I prefer the
\emph{proof-of-the-pudding} methodology. I am convinced that an
important part of the philosophical assessment of the Bayesian research
program has to do with its achievements or failures in contributing to
debates in philosophy which are not themselves debates about the status
of Bayesianism itself. In particular, it would be great news if insights
from Bayesian epistemology could be used to further development of
forensic AI and deepening our understanding of judiciary decision
making.

I will be using four methods: (a) informal conceptual analysis; (b)
formal conceptual analysis; (c) computational metods (R simulations,
etc.); and (d) case studies. I will rethink and model the existing
impliementations of whole-case-scale-BNs in legal evidence from the
perspective of the new framework and reconstruct cases which extensively
use probabilistic reasoning, but for which BNs have not been yet
proposed. Both the literature already listed and many textbooks on
quantitative evidence in forensics are great sources of such cases.

What the project will uniquely bring to the table is joining the
familiarity with epistemological debates on the nature of coherence
(which legal probabilists like Vlek or Fenton ignore or are unaware of),
familiarity with the details of evidence assessment in legal cases
(which formal epistemologists such as Fitelson ignore) and technical
skill to programmatically implement, simulate and test various
theoretical moves.

A larger initiative involving reconstructing various cases using
different representation methods and comparing the representations,
called \emph{Probability and statistics in forensic science}, took place
at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences. My approach
will be in the same vein.

I have extensive experience in analytic philosophy, conceptual analysis,
philosophical logic and probabilistic and decision-theoretic methods as
deployed in philosophical contexts. I also have teaching and publishing
record that involves statistical programming in the \textsf{\textbf{R}}
language (my sample programming projects can be visited at
\url{https://rfl-urbaniak.github.io/menu/projects.html}), and so am also
competent to develop AI implementations and tests of the ideas to be
developed.

One research risk is that it will turn out that some of the informal
requirements cannot be spelled out in probabilistic terms, or expressed
in terms of properties of Bayesian networks. In such an event, I will
study the reasons for this negative result. It might happen that there
are independent reasons to abandon a given condition, or it might be the
case that probabilistic inexplicability of a given condition is an
argument against the probabilistic approach. Either way, finding out
which option holds and why would also lead to a deeper understanding of
the framework and lead to a publication in academic journals. Another
research risk is that the case studies will show that other methods are
more efficient or transparent. This would itself constitute a result
that could be used to further modify the framework so that its best
aspects could be preserved, while the disadvantages discovered during
case studies avoided.
