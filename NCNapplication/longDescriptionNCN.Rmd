# Scientific goal

<!-- (description of the problem to be solved, research questions and hypotheses) -->




As many miscarriages of justice indicate, scientific evidence is easily misinterpreted in court. This happens mostly because of the communication gap between the parties involved.  For this reason, methods are needed to  support   proper assessment of evidence in such contexts.  The assessment of evidence in the court of law can be viewed from at least three  perspectives: as an interplay of arguments, as an assessment of  probabilities involved, or as an interaction of competing narrations. Each  perspective has been developed into a full-blown account of   legal reasoning [@di2018evidential; @vanEemeren2017]. While individually each of these strains has been investigated, exploration of  the relations between them is in a rather early stage. Crucially, the criticism of the probabilistic approach present in the literature have not been satisfactorily adressed by the proponents of legal probablism.


The \textbf{goal of this project} is to contribute to the \textbf{development of legal probabilism}  by formulating its variant that  accomodates important \textbf{insights provided by its critics}. A crucial point of criticism is that the fact-finding process  should  be conceptualized as \textbf{a competition of narrations}. I plan to develop methods that allow the probabilist to take this perspective, and explain how such methods allow the legal probabilist to address various other objections present in the literature. The key idea is that once  \textbf{narrations are represented as bayesian networks, various criteria on,  features of  and operations on narrations can be explicated in terms of corresponding properties of and operations on bayesian networks}. The conceptual developments are accompanied by  technical accounts. \textbf{\textsf{R}} code  capturing to the technical features developed is made available to the reader.   Thus, the output will be a \textbf{unifying extended probabilistic model embracing key aspects of the narrative and argumentative approaches, susceptible to AI implementation.}  The methods employed include: Bayesian statistical methods (including Bayesian approach to higher-order probability), imprecise probabilities and Bayesian networks.
