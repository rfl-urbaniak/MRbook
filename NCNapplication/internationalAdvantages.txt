In this project I plan to cooperate with Prof. Marcello Di Bello (Arizona State University).
Our cooperation so far has been immensely fruitful. Some of our papers published in
very good journals include criticisms and responses to each other's views,
and we ended up co-authoring the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
entry on Legal Probabilism (accepted, final version to be published in a few weeks).

At this stage, we started working on a book proposal devoted to improving on
the state of the art in legal probabilism and the goal is to work on the book and
a few resulting papers with the project I am applying for.

The key aspect of the cooperation is that our interests and competences complement each other.
Prof. Di Bello is much more versed in legal philosophy, while I am more focused on the technicalities.
In result, our work - we hope - will find a balance between philosophical relevance and formal progress.
Part of my research plan is to spend six months near the end of the duration
of the project at Arizona State University, intensely working with Prof. Di Bello on polishing the
final version of the book.
