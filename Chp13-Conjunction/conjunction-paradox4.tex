\maketitle

The standard of proof in criminal and civil trials is a criterion of
decision. If the evidence meets the standard of proof, the defendant
should be judged criminally or civilly liable, and otherwise the
accusation should be dismissed. According to many legal probabilists, a
verdict against the defendant is warranted in case the evidence
establishes, with a probability above a suitable threshold, that the
defendant is criminally or civilly liable (see Bernoulli, 1713; Dekay,
1996; Kaplan, 1968; Kaye, 1979; Laplace, 1814; Laudan, 2006). In
criminal cases, the bar is high, so the threshold will be, say, `at
least .95 probability.' In civil cases, the bar is lower, so the
threshold will be, say, `at least .5 probability.'

This interpretation of the standard of proof is simple and elegant.
Chapters 11 \todo{REFER TO EARLIER CHAPTER} showed how the .95 and .5
thresholds can be justified within the framework of statistical decision
theory. But, unfortunately, this interpretation is not without problems.
Chapter 12 \todo{REFER TO EARLIER CHAPTER} examined a first theoretical
problem: the paradox of naked statistical evidence. The present chapter
examines a second theoretical problem:
\textbf{the difficulty with conjunction}, also known as
\textbf{the conjunction paradox}. Section \ref{sec:difficulty} describes
in some detail the contours of the problem. Sections \ref{sec:strength}
and \ref{sec:comparative} articulate two broad strategies that legal
probabilists have pursued as a response to this difficulty. These
strategies are promising and worth examining, but we show that they are
ultimately unsatisfactory. Sections \ref{sec:reject} and
\ref{sec:proposal} put forward our own proposal.

Our proposal for addressing the difficulty with conjunction complements
our solution to the problem of naked statistical evidence. Both problems
underscore an important fact about trial proceedings. Even though, on a
general level, the two sides in a trial disagree about whether the
defendant is guilty (or civilly liable), their disagreement is more
fine-grained than that. The two sides disagree about a case-specific
story or account tailored to the individual defendant. Conclusions about
the defendant's guilt (or civil liability) are then reached via an
assessment of the truth of these more factually specific propositions.
This perspective affords a better understanding of how standards of
proof operate in a trial.

\hypertarget{formulating-the-difficulty}{%
\section{Formulating the difficulty}\label{formulating-the-difficulty}}

\label{sec:difficulty}

First formulated by Cohen (1977), the difficulty with conjunction has
enjoyed a great deal of scholarly attention every since (Allen, 1986;
Allen \& Pardo, 2019; Allen \& Stein, 2013; Cheng, 2012; Clermont, 2012;
Dawid, 1987; Haack, 2014; Schwartz \& Sober, 2017; Spottswood, 2016;
Stein, 2005). This difficulty arises when a claim of wrongdoing, in a
civil or criminal proceeding, is broken down into its constituent
elements. For example, suppose the prosecution should establish two
claims: first, that the defendant caused the victim's death; and second,
that the defendant's action was premeditated. By the probability
calculus, whenever two claims \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, the
probability of their conjunction \(\pr{A\wedge B}\) is the product of
the individual probabilities, \(\pr{A}\times \pr{B}\). The probability
of the conjunction should therefore be lower than the probability of the
independent conjuncts so long as these do not have probability one. So,
even when the probability of each conjunct is a above a suitable
threshold, the probability of the conjunction might be below the
threshold. This is an undisputed fact about probability. But, once the
standard of proof is equated to a probability threshold, it follows that
establishing each individual conjunct by the required standard of proof
need not be enough to establish the overall claim of wrongdoing (the
conjunction) by the required standard.

Cohen (1977) and others after him believe that this outcome is
counter-intuitive and runs contrary to trial practice. More
specifically, they believe that common law systems subscribe to a
\textbf{conjunction principle}, according to which if two claims, \(A\)
and \(B\), are established according to the governing standard of proof,
so is their conjunction \(A\wedge B\) (and \emph{vice versa}). If the
conjunction principle holds, the following must be equivalent:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}
{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Separate} &   $A$ is established by standard $S$ and $B$ is established by standard $S$\\   
\textbf{Overall}  &   The conjunction $A \et B$ is established by standard $S$  \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent If we generalize to more than just two constituent claims, the
conjunction principle requires that:

\[S[C_1 \wedge C_2  \wedge \dots \wedge  C_k] \Leftrightarrow S[C_1] \wedge S[C_2]  \wedge \dots \wedge  S[C_k],\]

\noindent where \(S[C_i]\) means that claim or hypothesis \(C_i\) is
established according to standard \(S\).

The principle goes in both directions. The implication from right to
left, call it \textbf{aggregation}, posits that establishing the
individual claims by the requisite standard is enough to establish the
conjunction by the same standard.\footnote{Aggregation bears some
  similarity to the multi-premise principle of epistemic closure. This
  principle reads: if a subject \(S\) knows \(A\) and knows \(B\), and
  also knows that \(A\) and \(B\) entail \(C\) (for example, they
  trivially entail \(A\wedge B\)), then \(S\) knows \(C\). The
  phenomenon of risk accumulation in lottery scenarios is usually
  deployed to challenge the multi-premise principle of epistemic
  closure. Risk accumulation also challenges the conjunction principle.
  On this point, see the discussion later in Section \ref{sec:reject}.}
The implication in the opposite direction, call it
\textbf{distribution}, posits that establishing the conjunction by the
requisite standard is enough to establish the individual claims by the
same standard. The difficulty with conjunction is traditionally
concerned with the failure of aggregation, but as we will see, on some
probabilistic explications of the standard of proof, distribution can
also fail.

We will eventually question and then reject the tenability of the
conjunction principle (more on this in Section \ref{sec:reject} and
\ref{sec:proposal}). For the time being, however, let us assume the
principle correctly captures two desired features of the standard of
proof. The principle has some degree of plausibility and is consistent
with the case law. For example, the United States Supreme Court writes
that in criminal cases

\begin{quote}
the accused [is protected] against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of \textit{every fact} necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. \linebreak 
(In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 1970)
\end{quote}

\noindent A plausible way to interpret this quotation is to assume the
following identity: to establish someone's guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt \textit{just is} to establish each element of the crime beyond a
reasonable doubt (abbreviated as \(\mathsf{BARD}\)). Thus,
\begin{align*}\mathsf{BARD}[C_1 \wedge C_2   \wedge \cdots \wedge C_k] \Leftrightarrow \mathsf{BARD}[C_1] \wedge \mathsf{BARD}[C_2]  \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathsf{BARD}[C_k],
\end{align*}

\noindent where the conjunction \(C_1 \et C_2 \cdots \et C_k\) comprises
all the material facts that, according to the applicable law, constitute
the crime with with the accused is charged. A similar argument could be
run for the standard of proof in civil cases, preponderance of the
evidence or clear and convincing evidence.

The problem for the legal probabilist is that the conjunction principle
conflicts with a threshold-based probabilistic interpretation of the
standard of proof. For suppose the prosecution in a criminal case
presents evidence that establishes claims \(A\) and \(B\), separately,
by the required probability, say about \(.95\) each. If each claim is
established by the requisite probability threshold, each claim is
established by the requisite standard (assuming the threshold-based
interpretation of the standard of proof). And if each claim is
established by the requisite standard, then liability as a whole is
established by the requisite standard (assuming the conjunction
principle). And yet, if the claims are independent, the probability of
their conjunction will be only \(.95\times .95 \approx .9\), below the
required \(.95\) threshold. So liability as a whole is \textit{not}
established by the requisite standard (assuming a threshold-based
probabilistic interpretation of the standard). This contradicts the
conjunction principle. Even though aggregation posits that establishing
each conjunct by the required standard of proof is enough to establish
the conjunction as a whole, the probability of each conjunct, in
isolation, can meet the required probability threshold without the
conjunction as a whole meeting the threshold.

This difficulty is persistent. It does not subside as the number of
constituent claims increases. If anything, the difficulty becomes more
apparent. Say the prosecution has established three separate claims by
\(.95\) probability. Their conjunction---again if the claims are
independent---would be about \(.85\) probable, even further below the
\(.95\) probability threshold. Nor does the difficulty with conjunction
generally subside if the claims are no longer regarded as independent.
The probability of the conjunction \(A \et B\), without the assumption
of independence, equals \(\pr{A \vert B} \times \pr{B}\) or
\(\pr{B \vert A} \times \pr{A}\). But if claims \(A\) and \(B\),
separately, are established with \(.95\) probability, enough for each to
meet the threshold, the probability of \(A \et B\) should still be below
the \(.95\) threshold unless \(\pr{A \vert B}\) or \(\pr{B \vert A}\)
equal one.\footnote{For example, that someone premeditated a harmful act
  against another (call it \textsf{premed}) makes it more likely that
  they did cause harm in the end (call it \textsf{harm}). Since
  \(\pr{\textsf{harm} \vert \textsf{premed}} > \pr{\textsf{harm}}\), the
  two claims are not independent. Still, premeditation does not always
  lead to harm, so \(\pr{\textsf{harm} \vert \textsf{premed}}\) will
  often be below \(1\). If both claims are established with \(.95\), the
  probability of the conjunction \(\textsf{harm} \et \textsf{premed}\)
  should still be below the \(.95\) threshold so long as
  \(\pr{\textsf{harm} \vert \textsf{premed}}\) is still below \(1\).}

\hypertarget{adding-the-evidence}{%
\subsection{Adding the evidence}\label{adding-the-evidence}}

So far we proceeded without mentioning the evidence in support of the
claims that constitute the wrongdoing. This is a simplification. As we
will see, it is crucial to pay attention to the supporting evidence.
With this in mind, the conjunction principle for two claims can be
formulated, as follows:
\[\text{S[$a, A$] and S[$b, B$] $\Leftrightarrow$ S[$a \wedge b, A\wedge B$]}.\]

\noindent In the case of more than two claims, the formulation of the
principle can be extended accordingly. Note that \(a\) and \(b\) denote
the evidence for claims \(A\) and \(B\) respectively, and \(S\) denotes
the standard by which the evidence establishes the claim in question.
So, for example, the expression S{[}\(a, A\){]} should be read as
`evidence \(a\) supports claim \(A\) by standard \(S\).' If we adopt the
threshold interpretation of the standard of proof, the expression
S{[}\(a, A\){]} should be interpreted as `evidence \(a\) establishes
claim \(A\) with a probability above a suitable threshold \(t\)
corresponding to standard \(S\)' or in symbols \(\pr{A \vert a}>t\). An
analogous probabilistic reading applies to the expressions
S{[}\(b, B\){]} and S{[}\(a \wedge b, A\wedge B\){]}.

Does a threshold-based probabilistic interpretation of the standard of
proof also conflict with this revised version of the conjunction
principle? The answer is positive, but seeing why requires a bit more
work. We should check whether, if both \(\pr{A \vert a}\) and
\(\pr{B \vert b}\) meet the threshold, say \(.95\), then so does
\(\pr{A\wedge B \vert a\wedge b}\). We are no longer just comparing the
probability of \(A\wedge B\) to the probability of \(A\) and the
probability of \(B\) as such. Rather, we are comparing the probability
of \(A \wedge B\) given the combined evidence \(a \wedge b\) to the
probability of \(A\) given evidence \(a\) and the probability of \(B\)
given evidence \(b\).

We first start with a stylized example and then generalize to a large
class of cases. Consider an aggravated assault case in which the
prosecution should establish, first, that the defendant injured the
victim, and second, that the defendant knew he was interacting with a
public official. A witness testimony (call it \textsf{witness}) is
offered in support of the proposition that the defendant injured the
victim (call this proposition \textsf{injury}). In addition, the
defendant's call to an emergency number (call it \textsf{emergency}) is
offered as evidence for the proposition that the defendant knew he was
interacting with a firefighter (call this proposition
\textsf{firefighther}). If
\(\pr{\textsf{injury} \vert \textsf{witness}}\) and
\(\pr{\textsf{firefighter} \vert \textsf{emergency} }\) both meet the
required probability threshold, it does not necessarily follow that
\(\pr{\textsf{injury} \wedge \textsf{firefighter} \vert \textsf{witness} \wedge \textsf{emergency}}\)
also meets the threshold. To see why that is, we need to make two
assumptions. The first is that
\(\pr{\textsf{injury} \vert \textsf{witness}}=\pr{\textsf{injury} \vert \textsf{witness} \wedge \textsf{emergency}}\).
This assumption is plausible: that the defendant called an emergency
number should not make it more (or less) likely that the defendant would
cause injury to someone. The second assumption is that
\(\pr{\textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{emergency} }=\pr{\textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{witness} \wedge \textsf{emergency} \wedge \textsf{injury}}\).
This assumption is also plausible: that the defendant injured the victim
and there is a testimony to that effect does not make it more (or less)
likely that the victim was a firefighter. Admittedly, more is needed to
justify these assumptions than an appeal to plausibility, a point to
which we will soon return. But, granting for now that the two
assumptions hold, it follows that:\footnote{By the chain rule and the
  independence assumptions \(\pr{A | a}=\pr{A | a \wedge b}\) and
  \(\pr{B | b}=\pr{B | a \wedge b \wedge A}\), the following holds:
  \begin{align*}
  \pr{A \wedge  B \vert a \wedge b}& =\pr{A \vert a \wedge b} \times \pr{B \vert  a \wedge b \wedge A}\\
   & = \pr{A \vert a} \times \pr{B \vert  b}
   \end{align*}}
\[\pr{\textsf{injury} \wedge \textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{witness} \wedge \textsf{emergency}}= \pr{\textsf{injury} \vert \textsf{witness}} \times \pr{\textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{emergency}}. \]

\noindent If the equality holds, even when
\(\pr{\textsf{injury} \vert \textsf{witness}}\) and
\(\pr{\textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{emergency} }\) meet the
required probability threshold,
\(\pr{\textsf{injury} \wedge \textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{witness} \wedge \textsf{emergency}}\)
will not, at least provided both
\(\pr{\textsf{injury} \vert \textsf{witness}}\) and
\(\pr{\textsf{firefighther} \vert \textsf{emergency} }\) are below 1 (as
is usually the case given that the evidence offered in a trial is
fallible). The conclusion is that aggregation is violated.

So, in at least one case and under seemingly plausible assumptions, the
revised conjunction principle fails if the standard of proof is
interpreted as a probability threshold. But can we say something more
general? To address this question, we will now represent by means of
Bayesian networks the relationship between claims \(A\), \(B\) and the
conjunction \(A\wedge B\), as well as the supporting evidence \(a\),
\(b\) and the conjunction \(a\wedge b\).

\hypertarget{independent-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Independent hypotheses}\label{independent-hypotheses}}

We already studied Bayesian networks in Chapter 6.
\todo{REF TO OTHER CHAPETR} Here we only sketch the essential ideas. A
Bayesian network is a formal model that consists of a graphical part (a
directed acyclic graph, \textsf{DAG}) and a numerical part (a
probability table).

The nodes in the graph represent random variables that can take
different values. For ease of exposition, we will use `nodes' and
`variables' interchangeably. The nodes are connected by directed edges
(arrows). No loops are allowed, hence the name acyclic.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{conjunction-paradox4_files/figure-latex/fig:hEDAG-1} \end{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
& $H$ & $\neg H$ \\
\hline
$E$ & $\pr{E \vert H}$ & $\pr{E\vert \neg H}$ \\
$\neg E$ & $\pr{\neg E\vert H}$ & $\pr{\neg E\vert \neg H}$ \\
\end{tabular}

\caption{DAG of the simplest evidential relation along with a probability table}
\label{fig:hEDAG}
\end{wrapfigure}

The simplest evidential relation, one of evidence bearing on a
hypothesis, can be represented by the directed graph displayed in Figure
\ref{fig:hEDAG}. The arrow need not have a causal interpretation. The
direction of the arrow indicates which conditional probabilities should
be supplied in the probability table. Since the arrow goes from \(H\) to
\(E\), we should specify the probabilities of the different values of
\(E\) conditional on the different values of \(H\).

Return now to the difficulty with conjunction. We will first examine the
case in which the two hypotheses \(A\) and \(B\) are probabilistically
independent. We will relax this assumption later. The two directed
graphs visualized in Figure \ref{fig:abBDAG} represent two items of
evidence each supporting its own hypothesis: \(a\) supports \(A\) and
\(b\) supports \(B\). To represent the conjunction \(A\wedge B\), a
conjunction node \(AB\) is added and arrows are drawn from nodes \(A\)
and \(B\) into node \(AB\) (Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter}).
This arrangement makes it possible to express the meaning of
\(A\wedge B\) via a probability table that mirrors the truth table for
the conjunction in propositional logic (see Table
\ref{tab:CPTconjunction}).\footnote{The difference is that the values
  \(1\) and \(0\) stand for two different things depending on where they
  are in the table. In the columns corresponding to the nodes they
  represent node states: true and false; in the \(\textsf{Pr}\) column
  they represent the conditional probability of a given state of \(AB\)
  given the states of \(A\) and \(B\) listed in the same row. For
  instance, take a look at row two. It says: if \(A\) and \(B\) are both
  in states 1, then the probability of \(AB\) being in state 0 is 0. In
  principle we could use `true' and `false' instead of 1 and 0 to
  represent states, but the numeric representation is easier to use in
  programming, which we do quite a bit in the background, so the reader
  might as well get used to this harmless ambiguity.}

\end{wraptable}

The resulting graph, call it \textsf{DAG 1}, satisfies the desired
independence assumptions. First, the two claims \(A\) and \(B\) are
probabilistically independent of one another. Their independence is
guaranteed by the fact that the conjunction node \(AB\) is a collider
and thus no information flows through
it.\footnote{A formal treatment of this point is provided in Chapter 6.}\todo{REFER TO OTHER CHAPTER}
Second, the supporting items of evidence \(a\) and \(b\) are also
probabilistically independent of one another. The reason is the same:
node \(AB\) blocks any flow of information between the evidence nodes.
Notably, the independence of the items of evidence is not always
explicitly stated in the formulation of the conjunction paradox. The
good thing is that the Bayesian network makes such assumptions explicit.

With this set-up in place, the conjunction paradox arises because
aggregation is violated. By the theory of Bayesian networks,
\textsf{DAG 1} in Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter} ensures the
following:\footnote{This is because the only path between \textsf{A} and
  \textsf{B} goes through \textsf{AB}, which is a collider; as long as
  we do not condition on it, all paths between \textsf{A} and \textsf{B}
  remain blocked. See Chapter 6 on Bayesian networks for details on this
  point.} \todo{REFER TO APPROPRIATE CHAPTER} \begin{align*}
\pr{A \wedge  B \vert a \wedge b}& =\pr{A \vert a \wedge b} \times \pr{B \vert  a \wedge b \wedge A}\\
 & = \pr{A \vert a} \times \pr{B \vert  b}
 \end{align*}

\noindent Thus, even when claims \(A\) and \(B\) are sufficiently
probable given their supporting evidence \(a\) and \(b\) (for a fixed
threshold \(t\))---in symbols, \(\pr{A \vert a}>t\) and
\(\pr{B \vert b}>t\)---it does not follow that \(A \et B\) is
sufficiently probable given combined evidence \(a\et b\) provided (as is
normally the case) neither \(\pr{A \vert a}\) nor \(\pr{B \vert b}\)
equal 1. As before, the conjunction principle fails because aggregation
fails.

The argument here goes beyond the specific example about aggravated
assault in the previous section. The argument only assumes that the
directed graph in Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter} is an adequate
representation of a situation in which two items of evidence, \(a\) and
\(b\), support their own hypothesis, \(A\) and \(B\). The graph encodes
two plausible relations of probabilistic independence: between
hypotheses \(A\) and \(B\) and between items of evidence \(a\) and
\(b\). The theory of Bayesian networks does the rest of the work.

\hypertarget{dependent-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Dependent hypotheses}\label{dependent-hypotheses}}

Consider now what happens if claims \(A\) and \(B\) are not regarded as
probabilistically independent. To represent this, it is enough to draw
an arrow between nodes \(A\) and \(B\). The modified graph is displayed
in Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAG2chapter}, call it \textsf{DAG 2}. The
open path between nodes \(A\) and \(B\) no longer guarantees the
probabilistic independence of \(A\) and \(B\) or the independence of
evidence nodes \(a\) and \(b\). But the items of evidence are still
probabilistically independent of one another \textit{conditional} on
their respective hypothesis. That is,
\(\pr{a \vert A}=\pr{a \vert A \wedge b}\) and
\(\pr{b \vert B}=\pr{b \vert B \wedge a}\). So \(a\) and \(b\) still
count as independent lines of evidence despite not being
(unconditionally) probabilistically independent.\footnote{Here is an
  illustration of the idea of independent lines of evidence without
  unconditional independence. Suppose the same phenomenon (say blood
  pressure) is measured by two instruments. The reading of the two
  instruments (say `high' blood pressure) should be
  \textit{probabilistically dependent} of one another. After all, if the
  instruments were both infallible and they were measuring the same
  phenomenon, they should give the exact same reading. On the other
  hand, the two instruments measuring the same phenomenon should count
  as \textit{independent lines of evidence}. This fact is rendered in
  probabilistic terms by means of probabilistic independence conditional
  on the hypothesis of interest. These ideas can be worked out more
  systematically in the language of Bayesian networks. Roughly, two
  variables are probabilistically dependent if there is an open path
  between them. On the other hand, an open path can be closed by
  conditioning on one of the variables along the path. For a more
  rigorous exposition of the notions of open and closed paths, see
  Chapter 6.} \todo{CITE EARLIER CHAPTERS}

The difficulty with conjunction arises even when hypotheses \(A\) and
\(B\) are no longer assumed to be independent. Using a simulation we can
study how often, in principle, the joint posterior
\(\pr{A\wedge B \vert a \wedge b}\) is below both the individual
posteriors \(\pr{A \vert a}\) and \(\pr{B \vert b}\). We simulated
10,000 random Bayesian networks based on \textsf{DAG 1} (independent
hypotheses) and \textsf{DAG 2} (dependent hypotheses). Assuming that
each possible network has an equal probability of occurring, the joint
posterior is lower than both individual posteriors 68\% of the time for
\textsf{DAG 1}, and around 60\% for \textsf{DAG 2} (see the appendix for
details). This result agrees with Schwartz \& Sober (2017) who point out
that, if hypotheses \(A\) and \(B\) are probabilistically dependent on
one another, aggregation will fail less often. Still, postulating a
dependence between hypotheses does little for solving the difficulty
with conjunction since a drop in the failure rate from 68\% to 60\% is
limited.

\hypertarget{evidential-strength}{%
\section{Evidential Strength}\label{evidential-strength}}

\label{sec:strength}

The previous section demonstrated that aggregation fails in a large
class of cases if the standard of proof is understood as a posterior
probability threshold. Some believe that such failures are strong enough
ground to advocate a different conception of probability, along the
lines of Baconian probability (Cohen, 2008), fuzzy logic or belief
functions (Clermont, 2013), or reject legal probabilism altogether
(Allen \& Stein, 2013). But posterior probability thresholds are not the
only way of understanding standards of proof from a probabilistic
perspective. Standards of proof can also be modeled using probabilistic
measures of \textit{evidential strength}. This is the approach we
explore in this section.

Two common probabilistic measures of evidential strength are the Bayes
factor and the likelihood ratio. We discussed them earlier in Chapter 5.
\todo{REFER TO EARLIER CHAPTERS} As we show below, under plausible
assumptions, these measures of evidential strength validate one
direction of the conjunction principle: aggregation. If \(a\) is
sufficiently strong evidence in favor of \(A\) and \(b\) is sufficiently
strong evidence in favor of \(B\), then \(a\wedge b\) is sufficiently
strong evidence in favor of the conjunction \(A \wedge B\). In fact, the
evidential support for the conjunction will often exceed that for the
individual claims, a point already made by Dawid (1987) who wrote that
`suitably measured, the support supplied by the conjunction of several
independent testimonies exceeds that supplied by any of its
constituents' (97).\footnote{Dawid's claim holds for the Bayes factor,
  but does not hold for the likelihood ratio. The joint likelihood ratio
  may be lower than one of the individual likelihood ratios, although it
  is not lower than both; more on this later in this section.}

Dawid thought that vindicating aggregation was enough for the
conjunction paradox to `evaporate.' But, as we show below, this is not
quite right. On the evidential strength interpretation of the standard
of proof, the other direction of the conjunction principle,
distribution, fails. If \(a \wedge b\) is sufficiently strong evidence
in favor of \(A \wedge B\), it does not follow that \(a\wedge b\) is
sufficiently strong evidence in favor of \(A\) or that \(a\wedge b\) is
sufficiently strong evidence in favor of \(B\). This is odd. If we
interpret the standard of proof using evidential strength, one could
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that \(A \wedge B\) (say the
defendant killed the victim \textit{and} acted intentionally) while
failing to establish one of the conjuncts.

The prospects for legal probabilism look dim. If the standard of proof
is understood as a posterior probability threshold, the conjunction
principle fails because aggregation fails (previous section). If,
instead, the standard of proof is understood as a threshold relative to
evidential strength, the conjunction principle still fails because
distribution fails (this section). From a probabilistic perspective, it
seems impossible to capture both directions of the conjunction
principle. In what follows, we defend more precisely the claim that, on
the evidential strength approach, aggregation succeeds but distribution
fails. The argument is laborious. The reader should arm themselves with
patience or take our word for it and jump ahead. The curious reader is
welcome to read the appendix for the technical details.

\hypertarget{combined-support-bayes-factor}{%
\subsection{Combined support: Bayes
factor}\label{combined-support-bayes-factor}}

The first part of the argument shows that the combined support supplied
by multiple pieces of evidence (e.g.~\(a\wedge b\)) for a conjunctive
claim (e.g.~\(A\wedge B\)) typically exceeds the individual support
supplied by individual pieces of evidence for individual claims. This
claim holds for the Bayes factor and to some extent for the likelihood
ratio. We start with the Bayes factor \(\pr{E \vert H}/\pr{E}\) as our
measure of the support of \(E\) in favor of \(H\). As is apparent from
Bayes' theorem,

\[\pr{H \vert E} = \frac{\pr{E \vert H}}{\pr{E}}\times \pr{H},\]

\noindent the Bayes factor measures the extent to which a piece of
evidence increases the probability of a hypothesis, as compared to its
prior probability. The greater the Bayes factor (for values above one),
the stronger the support of \(E\) in favor of \(H\).

Suppose Bayes factors \(\nicefrac{\pr{a \vert A}}{\pr{a}}\) (abbreviated
\(BF_A\)) and \(\nicefrac{\pr{b \vert B}}{\pr{b}}\) (abbreviated
\(BF_B\)) are greater than one. That is, items of evidence \(a\) and
\(b\) positively support \(A\) and \(B\), separately. The combined
support here is (see the appendix for a proof): \begin{align*}
\frac{\pr{a \wedge b \vert A \wedge B}}{\pr{a \wedge b}} &= \frac{\pr{a \vert A}}{\pr{a}} \times \frac{\pr{b \vert B}}{\pr{b}}\\
BF_{AB} &= BF_{A} \times BF_{B}
\end{align*} \noindent Consequently, the combined support \(BF_{AB}\) is
always higher than the individual support so long as the individual
pieces of evidence positively support their respective hypothesis. This
claim holds assuming hypotheses \(A\) and \(B\) are independent and
items of evidence \(a\) and \(b\) are independent. These assumptions are
validated by \textsf{DAG 1} in Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter}.
Under these circumstances, Dawid's claim that `the support supplied by
the conjunction of several independent testimonies exceeds that supplied
by any of its constituents' (if support is to be measured in terms of
Bayes factor) is verified.\footnote{The result holds beyond two pieces
  of evidence; see Figure \ref{fig:bfconjunction5}. On the other hand,
  if both items of evidence oppose the individual hypotheses, the joint
  Bayes factor will be lower than any of the individual ones. Neutral
  evidence always results in a joint Bayes factor of one.}

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{conjunction-paradox4_files/figure-latex/bfconjunction5-1} \end{center}
\caption{Joint Bayes factors for one, two and five items of evidence, for individual Bayes factors greater than one (positive support), equal to one (neutral support) and below one (negative support). The independence assumptions in Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter}, \textsf{DAG 1}, hold.}
\label{fig:bfconjunction5}
\end{figure}

Even when \(A\) and \(B\) are not probabilistically independent, the
combined Bayes factor \(BF_{AB}\) will still be greater than both the
individual Bayes factor \(BF_{A}\) and \(BF_{B}\) if the probabilistic
measure fits \textsf{DAG 2} in Figure \ref{fig:conjunctionDAG2chapter}.
To see why, first note that the following holds (see the appendix for a
proof): \begin{align}
BF_{AB} = \frac{\pr{a \wedge b\vert A\wedge B}}{\pr{a \wedge b}}&= \frac{\pr{a |A}}{\pr{a}} \times \frac{\pr{b |B}}{\pr{b|a}}&=  BF_{A}\times BF^{'}_{B} \nonumber \\
 & = \frac{\pr{a |A}}{\pr{a | b}} \times \frac{\pr{b |B}}{\pr{b}}& =  BF^{'}_{A}\times BF_{B}  \nonumber 
 \end{align}

\noindent The difference from the case of independent hypotheses is that
\(BF_B=\nicefrac{\pr{b \vert B}}{\pr{b}}\) is now replaced by
\(BF^{'}_B=\nicefrac{\pr{b \vert B}}{\pr{b\vert a}}\), or alternatively
\(BF_A=\nicefrac{\pr{a \vert A}}{\pr{a}}\) by
\(BF^{'}_A=\nicefrac{\pr{a \vert A}}{\pr{a\vert b}}\).\footnote{Since
  \(b\) need not be probabilistically independent of \(a\), there is no
  guarantee that \(\pr{b \vert a}=\pr{b}\) or \(\pr{a \vert b}=\pr{a}\).}
Still, if the probabilistic measure fits \textsf{DAG 2}, whenever
\(BF_B\) is greater than 1, so is \(BF^{'}_B\), and whenever \(BF_A\) is
greater than 1, so is \(BF^{'}_A\) (see the appendix for a proof). Thus,
the joint Bayes factor \(BF_{AB}\) will be greater than any of the
individual Bayes factors.\footnote{In contrast, if the underlying
  \textsf{DAG} were to contain a direct dependence between the items of
  evidence, the joint Bayes factor could be lower than either of the
  individual Bayes factors (see the appendix for a proof).}

\hypertarget{combined-support-likelihood-ratio}{%
\subsection{Combined support: likelihood
ratio}\label{combined-support-likelihood-ratio}}

We now run a similar argument for the likelihood ratio, another
probabilistic measure of evidential strength. The likelihood
ratio---extensively discussed in Chapter
5\todo{REFER TO EARLIER CHAPTER}---compares the probability of the
evidence on the assumption that a hypothesis of interest is true
(\textit{sensitivity}) and the probability of the evidence on the
assumption that the negation of the hypothesis is true
(\textit{1- specificity}). That is,
\[\frac{\pr{E \vert H}}{\pr{E \vert \neg H}}=\frac{\textit{sensitivity}}{\textit{1- specificity}}\]

\noindent The greater the likelihood ratio (for values above one), the
stronger the evidential support in favor of the hypothesis (as
contrasted to its negation).

The question is whether the combined support measured by the joint
likelihood ratio
\[\frac{\pr{a\wedge b \vert A\wedge B}}{\pr{a \wedge b \vert \neg (A\wedge B)}}\]

\noindent exceeds the individual support measured by the individual
likelihood ratios \(\nicefrac{\pr{a \vert A}}{\pr{a \vert \neg A}}\) and
\(\nicefrac{\pr{b \vert B}}{\pr{b \vert \neg B}}\). Under suitable
assumptions, the answer is positive. So, details aside, Bayes factor and
likelihood ratio agree here. The argument for the likelihood ratio,
however, is more laborious.

We start with the fact that, in a large class of cases (see the appendix
for a proof),

\begin{align*}
LR_{AB} & = \frac{\pr{a\wedge b \vert A\wedge B}}{\pr{a \wedge b \vert \neg (A\wedge B)}} = \frac{\pr{a \vert A} \times \pr{b \vert B}}
 {\frac{\pr{\neg A}\pr{B \vert \neg A} \pr{a \vert \neg A}\pr{b \vert B} + \pr{A}\pr{\neg B \vert A} \pr{a \vert A }\pr{b \vert \neg B} + \pr{\neg A}\pr{\neg B \vert \neg A } \pr{a \vert \neg A}\pr{b \vert \neg B}}{\pr{\neg A}\pr{B \vert \neg A} + \pr{A}\pr{\neg B \vert A } + \pr{\neg A}\pr{\neg B \vert \neg A} }}
\end{align*}

\noindent This equality holds whether or not hypotheses \(A\) and \(B\)
are probabilistically independent. But, given the many unknowns here, it
pays to make some simplifications if only for illustrative purposes.

The first temporary simplification we make is to assume that the
sensitivity and specificity of the items of evidence are both equal to
the same value \(x\). Second, we assume that \(A\) and \(B\) are
probabilistically independent in agreement with \textsf{DAG 1} (Figure
\ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter}). The combined likelihood ratio can now
be plotted as a function of \(x\). Figure \ref{fig:jointLRMarcello}
shows that the combined likelihood ratio always exceeds the individual
likelihood ratios whenever they are greater than one (or in other words,
as is usually assumed, the two pieces of evidence provide positive
support for their respective hypotheses).\footnote{Interestingly, the
  combined likelihood ratio varies depending on the prior probabilities
  \(\pr{A}\) and \(\pr{B}\).} As with the Bayes factor, the combined
likelihood ratio exceeds the individual likelihood ratios.

\begin{figure}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{conjunction-paradox4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1} \end{center}

\caption{Combined likelihood ratios exceeds individual Likelihood ratios as soon as sensitivity is above .5. Changes in the prior probabilities $\pr{A}$ and $\pr{B}$ do not invalidate this result.}
\label{fig:jointLRMarcello}
\end{figure}

What happens if the two simplifying assumptions are relaxed? If the
items of evidence have different levels of sensitivity and specificity,
the combined likelihood ratio never goes below the lower of the two
individual likelihood ratios, but can be lower than the higher
individual likelihood ratio. We establish this claim by means of a
computer simulation (see the appendix for details). This holds if the
probabilistic measure fits \textsf{DAG 1} (independent hypotheses) or
\textsf{DAG 2} (dependent hypotheses), but fails---unsurprisingly---if
there is direct dependence between the pieces of evidence.\footnote{The
  simplified set-up from before does not contradict this claim but
  follows from it. In the simplified set-up, both individual likelihood
  ratios were the same, so whenever the joint likelihood was higher than
  the minimum of the individual likelihood ratios, it was higher than
  the both of them.} In this sense, the joint likelihood ratio behaves
differently than the joint Bayes factor since it is greater than the
lowest of the individual likelihood ratios, rather than being greater
than both of them. Consequently, Dawid's claim that `the support
supplied by the conjunction of several independent testimonies exceeds
that supplied by any of its constituents' should be amended. When it is
measured by the likelihood ratio, the evidential support supplied by the
conjunction of several independent items of evidence exceeds the support
supplied by at least one individual item of evidence but possibly not
all.

\hypertarget{vindicating-aggregation}{%
\subsection{Vindicating aggregation}\label{vindicating-aggregation}}

We have seen that under suitable assumptions the combined evidential
support is never below the lowest individual support. More precisely,
let \(\mathsf{str}[E, H]\) stand for the strength of the evidential
support of a piece of evidence \(E\) toward a hypothesis \(H\), measured
by the Bayes factor or the likelihood ratio. We have established the
following fact:

\[\mathsf{str}[a \wedge b, A\wedge B] \geq \text{min}(\mathsf{str}[a, A], \mathsf{str}[b, B]),\]
where the function \(\text{min}\) returns the lowest of its arguments.

This fact can be used to justify aggregation. To be sure, aggregation is
not directly a principle about evidential strength. It is a principle
about the standard of proof. That is:

\[S[a, A] \wedge S[b, B] \Rightarrow  S[a \wedge b, A\wedge B],\] where
the expression \(S[a, A]\) should be read as `evidence \(a\) supports
claim \(A\) by standard \(S\),' and similarly for \(S[b, B]\) and
\(S[a \wedge b, A\wedge B]\). So, to complete the argument, the standard
of proof \(S\) should be tied to evidential strength \(\mathsf{str}\).
How? The rule of decision could be: liability is proven according to the
governing standard of proof in case the strength of the evidential
support---measured by the Bayes factor or the likelihood ratio---meets a
suitably high threshold. More formally:

\[S[E, L] \Leftrightarrow \mathsf{str}[E, L]>t_{str},\] where \(E\) is
the total evidence available and \(L\) is the claim that the defendant
is criminally or civilly liable. On this reading, the threshold
\(t_{str}\) is not a probability between 0 and 1, but a number somewhere
above one. The greater this number, the more stringent the standard of
proof, for any value above one.

The only question left at this point concerns how one should identify
the appropriate evidential strength threshold \(t_{str}\). The answer
isn't obvious. Below we examine two possible approaches. The first
approach consists in fixing the threshold \(s_{str}\) to some critical
value. For example, the critical value for the likelihood ratio
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert L}}{\pr{E \vert \neg L}}\) can be fixed at 1 for
civil trials and greater than 100 for criminal trials. Similar
thresholds can be applied to the Bayes factor
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert L}}{\pr{E}}\). These values are plausible, since
the evidence against the defendant in criminal cases should be stronger
than in civil cases to justify a verdict of liability. But this approach
raises a further question. Why should critical values such as 1 for
civil trials and 100 for criminal trials be chosen? What is the
rationale for their choice? Why not, say, 10 and 1,000? A second, more
roundabout approach is better suited to address these questions.

The threshold for the Bayes factor and the threshold for the likelihood
ratio need not be fixed directly, but can instead be indirectly derived
from the threshold for the posterior probability by manipulating two
simple equations. Consider first the Bayes factor threshold. Since
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{ Bayes \: factor }=\frac{\mathsf{posterior }}{\mathsf{ prior}},
\end{align*}

\noindent the Bayes factor threshold, call it \(t_{BF}\), can be defined
as follows: \begin{align*}t_{BF} & = \frac{t}{\textsf{prior}},
\end{align*} where \(t\) is the posterior probability threshold. The
value of \(t\) can be determined in a decision-theoretic manner by
minimizing expected costs (see Chapter
11\todo{REFER TO ERALIER CHAPPER}). Once \(t\) is fixed in this way, the
value \(t_{BF}\) can be easily derived by the equations above. The same
strategy works for the likelihood ratio threshold, call it \(t_{LR}\).
By the odds version of Bayes' theorem,
\begin{align*}\textsf{likelihood ratio}=\frac{\textsf{posterior odds}}{\textsf{prior odds}}.
\end{align*} If the posterior ratio is fixed at, say \(t/1-t\), then the
value of \(t_{LR}\) can be easily obtained as follows:
\begin{align*}t_{LR} & = \frac{\nicefrac{t}{1-t}}{\textsf{prior odds}}.
\end{align*}

\noindent Note that thresholds \(t_{BF}\) and \(t_{LR}\) will depend on
the prior probability of the hypothesis. The higher the prior
probability, the lower the threshold. Whether this is a desirable
property of a decision threshold can be questioned, but a similar point
applies to the posterior threshold \(t\): the higher the prior
probability, the easier it is to meet the threshold.

This second approach allows for a principled method to identify the
critical thresholds, but incurs a major shortcoming: aggregation still
fails. There will be cases in which the conjuncts taken separately
satisfy the decision standard \(t_{BF}\) or \(t_{LR}\), while the
conjunction does not. To illustrate, consider a posterior probability
threshold of \(.95\) as might be appropriate in a criminal case. If the
individual claims \(A\) and \(B\) both have a prior probability of,
\mbox{say $.1$,} the Bayes factor threshold
\(t^A_{BF}=t_{BF}^B=\nicefrac{.95}{.1}=9.5\) for \(A\) or \(B\)
individually. Note the superscripts \(A\) and \(B\). The Bayes factor
threshold \(t_{BF}\) is indexed to the claim of interest because the
threshold is prior-dependent and thus claim-dependent (since different
claims have different prior probabilities). If, as is often assumed,
claims \(A\) and \(B\) are probabilistically independent, the composite
claim \(A \wedge B\) will be associated with the Bayes factor threshold
\(t^{A\wedge B}_{BF}=\nicefrac{.95}{(.1\times .1)}=95\), a much higher
value. Suppose each claim barely meet the 9.5 Bayes factor threshold.
Given independence, the joint Bayes factor results from multiplying the
individual Bayes factors, that is, \(9.5 \times 9.5=90.25\). This is not
quite enough to meet \(t^{A\wedge B}_{BF}=95\). So aggregation fails. An
analogous point holds for the likelihood ratio threshold.\footnote{Say
  \(A\) and \(B\) have prior probabilities of \(.2\) and \(.3\)
  respectively. On this approach, the likelihood ratio threshold for
  \(A\) and \(B\) will be \(t_{LR}^{A}\approx 76\) and
  \(t_{LR}^{B}a\approx 44\), assuming posterior probability threshold of
  0.95. The likelihood ratio threshold for the composite claim
  \(A \wedge B\) will be \(t^{A\wedge B}_{LR}\approx 297\). Suppose the
  individual likelihood ratios meet their threshold. And, for
  simplicity, suppose sensitivity and specificity of the individual
  items of supporting evidence are the same. In this case, for
  \(t_{LR}^{A}\) to be met, evidence \(a\) should have sensitivity (and
  specificity) of at least 0.988. For \(t_{LR}^{B}\) to be met, evidence
  \(b\) should have sensitivity (and specificity) of 0.978. Given these
  values, the combined likelihood ratio equals about 145, far short from
  the threshold \(t^{A\wedge B}_{LR}\approx 297\).} The culprit is the
fact that \(t_{BF}\) and \(t_{LR}\) have different values when applied
to individual claims \(A\) and \(B\) as opposed to the composite claim
\(A \wedge B\).

But not all hope is lost. Perhaps it is unsurprising that deriving the
evidential strength threshold from the posterior probability threshold
did not solve the problem. If there are reasons to reject the posterior
probability threshold, these reasons also apply,
\emph{mutatis mutandis}, to thresholds that are parasitic to it. Let us
return to the first, more straightforward approach. It consists in
fixing the evidential strength threshold independently of the posterior
probability threshold and regardless of the prior probability of the
hypothesis. Criminal cases would still have a higher decision threshold
than civil cases, but the threshold would be constant across individual
and composite claims. As noted before, however, this approach raises the
question of how the critical thresholds should be fixed in the first
place.\footnote{Since the threshold is no longer derived from the
  posterior probability threshold, standard decision theory cannot help
  here. We do not further examine this question, since this approach is
  not part of our ultimate solution to the conjunction paradox.} But the
good news is that the fixed threshold approach vindicates aggregation.
The argument is easy. As seen previously, the combined evidential
support is usually greater than at least one, if not all, individual
evidential supports, whether measured by the Bayes factor or the
likelihood ratio. So, for a fixed value of the threshold, whenever
\(BF_A\) and \(BF_B\) meet the threshold \(t_{BF}\), usually also the
combined Bayes factor \(BF_{AB}\) meets \(t_{BF}\). The same applies for
the likelihood ratio threshold. Whenever \(LR_A\) and \(LR_B\) meet the
threshold \(t_{LR}\), then usually also \(LR_{AB}\) meets \(t_{LR}\).
Aggregation is finally vindicated!

\hypertarget{the-failure-of-distribution}{%
\subsection{The failure of
distribution}\label{the-failure-of-distribution}}

But it is too soon to declare victory. The trouble is that, if the
evidential strength threshold is held fixed across individual and
composite claims, the principle of distribution becomes problematic.
This is the other direction of the conjunction principle. Distribution
posits that establishing the conjunction, by a governing standard of
proof, is sufficient for establishing the individual conjuncts:
\begin{align}
S[a \wedge b, A\wedge B] \Rightarrow S[a, A] \wedge S[b, B], \tag{DIS1}
\end{align} This is a seemingly uncontroversial principle. How can it
possibly fail? To be clear, the principle of distribution does not fail
if the standard of proof is understood as a posterior probability
threshold. After all, the probability of a conjunction cannot be higher
than the probability of its conjuncts. But distribution does fail if the
standard of proof is understood as an evidential strength threshold.

For suppose the joint Bayes factor,
\(\nicefrac{\pr{a \et b \vert A \et B}}{\pr{a \et b}}\), barely meets
the threshold. We have shown that, in a class of cases codified by
\textsf{DAG1} and \textsf{DAG2}, the joint Bayes factor exceeds the
individual ones. So, the joint Bayes factor can meet the threshold while
the individual ones might not. The argument is analogous for the joint
likelihood ratio and the individual ones. Looking at the graphs in
Figure \ref{fig:bfconjunction5} and Figure \ref{fig:jointLRMarcello}
should be enough to convince oneself that this is the case. So---if the
standard of proof is interpreted as a fixed evidential strength
threshold---even though the conjunction \(A \et B\) was proven according
to the desired standard, one of the individual claims might not.

We have just shown that principle (DS1) fails. But, perhaps, this
principle is not as obviously intuitive as one might have thought. Since
the evidence is not held constant throughout, the support supplied by
\(a\wedge b\) could be stronger than that supplied by \(a\) and \(b\)
individually. After all, the individual evidence \(a\) or \(b\) is
weaker evidence than the combined evidence \(a\wedge b\). At least one
might argue this way.

To accommodate this line of reasoning, here is a weaker distribution
principle: \begin{align}
S[a \wedge b, A\wedge B] \Rightarrow S[a \wedge b, A] \wedge S[a\wedge b, B]. \tag{DIS2}
\end{align}

\noindent This principle holds the evidence constant throughout and
seems less controversial. Indeed, it would be odd to say: the evidence
establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant caused the
victim's death \textit{and} did so intentionally, but the same evidence
does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant caused
the victim's death. It would also be odd to say: the evidence
establishes by preponderance that the defendant was speeding
\textit{and} run a red light, but the same evidence does not establish
by preponderance that the defendant was speeding. Yet, as explained in
the appendix, the distribution principle (DIS2) is in no better position
than (DIS1). If the standard of proof is understood as a fixed threshold
on evidential strength, measured by the likelihood ratio or the Bayes
factor, the principle (DIS2) would fail in a significant number of cases
under \textsf{DAG1} (independent hypotheses) as well as \textsf{DAG2}
(dependent hypotheses). This is a very serious difficulty for those who
wish to analyze the standard of proof by means of the Bayes factor or
the likelihood ratio.

\hypertarget{the-comparative-strategy}{%
\section{The comparative strategy}\label{the-comparative-strategy}}

\label{sec:comparative}

We hit two dead ends. The posterior probability threshold is subject to
the difficulty with conjunction, specifically, the failure of
aggregation (Section \ref{sec:difficulty}). The evidential strength
threshold is subject to another kind of difficulty, the failure of
distribution (Section \ref{sec:strength}). As a third approach, the
standard of proof can be understood comparatively. This approach has
been advanced by Cheng (2012) following the theory of relative
plausibility by Pardo \& Allen (2008). Say the prosecutor or the
plaintiff puts forward a hypothesis \(H_p\) about what happened. The
defense offers an alternative hypothesis, call it \(H_d\). On this
approach, rather than directly evaluating the support of \(H_p\) given
the evidence and comparing it to a threshold, we compare the support
that the evidence provides for two competing hypotheses \(H_p\) and
\(H_d\), and decide for the one that garners greater evidential support.

It is controversial whether this is what happens in all trial
proceedings, especially in criminal trials, if one thinks of the defense
hypothesis \(H_d\) as a substantial account of what has happened. The
defense may elect to challenge the hypothesis put forward by the other
party without proposing one of its own. In the O.J.~Simpson trial, for
example, the defense did not advance its own story about what happened,
but simply argued that the evidence provided by the prosecution, while
significant on its face to establish OJ's guilt, was riddled with
problems and deficiencies, and that the alternative explanations of the
evidence were at least to some extent plausible. This defense strategy
was enough to secure an acquittal. So, in order to create a reasonable
doubt about guilt, the defense does not always provide a full-fledged
alternative hypothesis. The supporters of the comparative approach might
respond, perhpas correctly, that this happens in a small number of
cases, even though in general---especially for tactical reasons---the
defense will provide an alternative hypothesis.

\hypertarget{comparing-posteriors}{%
\subsection{Comparing posteriors}\label{comparing-posteriors}}

We set aside these qualms and show that, in any event, the comparative
strategy is still unable to satisfactorily address the difficulty with
conjunction. To show this, we start by working out the comparative
strategy using posterior probabilities. Here, the standard of proof is
understood as follows: given a body of evidence \(E\) and two competing
hypotheses \(H_p\) and \(H_d\), the probability \(\pr{H_p \vert E}\)
should be suitably higher than \(\pr{H_d \vert E}\), or in other words,
the ratio \(\nicefrac{\pr{H_p \vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}\) should be
above a suitable threshold. Presumably, the ratio threshold should be
higher for criminal than civil cases, for example, greater than one for
civil cases and substantively above one for criminal
cases.\todo{refer to earlier chapter}\footnote{In the comparative
  approach---as Cheng (2012) shows---expected utility theory can set the
  appropriate threshold as a function of the costs and benefits of trial
  decisions. Suppose the costs of a false positive is \(c_{FP}\) and
  that of a false negative is \(c_{FN}\), both greater than zero.
  Intuitively, the decision rule should minimize the expected costs (see
  Chapter 11). That is, a finding against the defendant would be
  acceptable whenever its expected
  costs---\(\pr{H_d \vert E} \times c_{FP}\)---are smaller than the
  expected costs of an
  acquittal---\(\pr{H_p \vert E}\times c_{FN}\)---or in other words:
  \(\frac{\pr{H_p \vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}} > \frac{c_{FP}}{c_{FN}}\).
  In civil cases, it is customary to assume the costs ratio of false
  positives to false negatives equals one. So the rule of the decision
  would be: find against the defendant whenever \(\pr{H_p \vert E}\) is
  greater than \(\pr{H_d \vert E}\). In criminal trials, the costs ratio
  is considered higher, since convicting an innocent (false positive)
  should be more harmful or morally objectionable than acquitting a
  guilty defendant (false negative). So the rule of decision would be:
  convict whenever \(\pr{H_p \vert E}\) is substantively greater than
  \(\pr{H_d \vert E}\).} Note that \(H_p\) and \(H_d\) need not be one
the negation of the other.\footnote{If two hypotheses are exclusive and
  exhaustive, \(\nicefrac{\pr{H_p \vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}>1\)
  implies that \(\pr{H_p \vert E}>.5\), the standard probabilistic
  interpretation of the preponderance standard for civil cases, and
  \(\nicefrac{\pr{H_p \vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}>19\) implies that
  \(\pr{H_p \vert E}>.95\), a common interpretation of proof beyond a
  reasonable doubt.}

To see whether the comparative strategy just outlined solves the
difficulty with conjunction, we will work through a stylized case used
by Cheng himself. Suppose, in a civil case, the plaintiff claims that
the defendant was speeding (\(S\)) and that the crash caused her neck
injury (\(C\)). Here the plaintiff's hypothesis is \(S\et C\). Suppose,
given evidence \(E\), the conjuncts, taken separately, meet the decision
threshold: \begin{align}
 \nonumber 
 \frac{\pr{S\vert E}}{\pr{\neg S \vert E}} > 1   & & \frac{\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\neg C \vert E}} > 1
\end{align} \noindent To see whether aggregation is satisfied, we check
whether \(\nicefrac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}>1\). The key
is to decide on the defense hypothesis \(H_d\). Cheng reasons that there
are three alternative defense scenarios: \(H_{d_1}= S\et \n C\),
\(H_{d_2}=\n S \et C\), and \(H_{d_3}=\n S \et \n C\). How does \(H_p\)
compare to each of them? Assuming independence between \(C\) and \(S\),
we have:\footnote{We are assuming that \(E\) is the conjunction of two
  items of evidence, \(s\et c\), where \(s\) supports \(S\) and \(c\)
  supports \(C\). The inequalities holds on \textsf{DAG 1} in Figure
  \ref{fig:conjunctionDAGchapter} after replacing \(A\) and \(a\) by
  \(S\) and \(s\), and \(B\) and \(b\) by \(C\) and \(c\), respectively.}

\begin{align}\label{eq:cheng-multiplication}
\frac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{S\et \n C\vert E}} & = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{S \vert E}\pr{\n C \vert E}}  =\frac{\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n C \vert E}} > 1 \\
\nonumber
\frac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S\et C\vert E}} & = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}  = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}} > 1 \\
\nonumber
\frac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S\et \n C\vert E}} & = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}\pr{\n C \vert E}}   > 1 
\end{align}

\noindent So, whatever the defense hypothesis, the plaintiff's
hypothesis is more probable. At least in this case, whenever the
elements of a plaintiff's claim satisfy the decision threshold, so does
their conjunction. The left-to-right direction of the conjunction
principle---what we are calling aggregation---has been vindicated, at
least for simple cases involving independence. Success.

What about the opposite direction, distribution? Distribution is not
generally satisfied. Suppose
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}>1\), or in other
words, the combined hypothesis \(S \et C\) has been established by
preponderance of the evidence. The question is whether the individual
hypotheses have been established by the same standard, specifically,
whether \(\frac{\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n C \vert E}} > 1\) and
\(\frac{\pr{S\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}} > 1\). If
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}>1\), the combined
hypothesis is assumed to be more probable than any of the competing
hypotheses, in particular,
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{\neg S \et C \vert E}}>1\),
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{S \et \neg C \vert E}}>1\) and
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{\neg S \et \neg C \vert E}}>1\). We
have: \begin{align}\label{eq:cheng-multiplication-two}
1 < \frac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{S\et \n C\vert E}} & = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{S \vert E}\pr{\n C \vert E}}  =\frac{\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n C \vert E}} \\
\nonumber
1 < \frac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S\et C\vert E}} & = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}  = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}}  \\
\nonumber
1 < \frac{\pr{S\et C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S\et \n C\vert E}} & = \frac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}\pr{\n C \vert E}}   
\end{align}

\noindent In the first two cases, clearly, if the composite hypothesis
meets the threshold, so do the individual claims. But consider the third
case.
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}\pr{\n C \vert E}}\)
might be strictly greater than
\(\nicefrac{\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n C \vert E}}\) or
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}}\). It is possible that
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\vert E}\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}\pr{\n C \vert E}}\)
is greater than one, while
either\(\nicefrac{\pr{C\vert E}}{\pr{\n C \vert E}}\) or
\(\nicefrac{\pr{S\vert E}}{\pr{\n S \vert E}}\) are not, say when they
are 3 and 0.5, respectively. Distribution fails. And the same problem
would arise with a more stringent threshold as might be appropriate in
criminal cases.

There is a more general problem with Cheng's comparative approach. Much
of the heavy lifting here is done by the strategic splitting of the
defense line into multiple scenarios. Suppose, for illustrative
purposes, \(\pr{H_p\vert E}=0.37\) and the probability of each of the
defense lines given \(E\) is \(0.21\). This means that \(H_p\) wins with
each of the scenarios. We should then find against the defendant. But
should we? Given the evidence, the accusation is likely to be false,
because \(\pr{\n H_p \vert E}=0.63\). The problem generalizes. If, as
here, we individualize scenarios by Boolean combinations of elements of
a case, the more elements, the more alternative scenarios into which
\(\n H_p\) needs to be divided. This normally would lead to lowering
even further the probability of each of them (because now
\(\pr{\n H_p}\) needs to be split between more scenarios). If we take
this approach seriously, the more elements a case has, the more at a
disadvantage the defense is. This seems undesirable.

\hypertarget{comparing-likelihoods}{%
\subsection{Comparing likelihoods}\label{comparing-likelihoods}}

Instead of posterior probabilities, we could consider comparing
likelihoods and their ratios. The standard of proof would then be as
follows: the ratio between the likelihoods
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert H_p}}{\pr{E \vert H_d}}\) should be above a
suitable threshold. Note that the posterior ratio
\(\nicefrac{\pr{H_p \vert E}}{\pr{H_d \vert E}}\) from before was
replaced by the likelihood ratio
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert H_p}}{\pr{E \vert H_d}}\) where \(H_d\) and
\(H_p\), as before, need not be exhaustive hypotheses. In civil cases,
the likelihood ratio should perhaps be just be above 1, meaning that the
evidence supports \(H_p\) more strongly than it supports \(H_d\). In
criminal cases, the ratio should be several orders of magnitude above
one. This approach runs into the same problem as Cheng's. It cannot
justify distribution.

We do not provide all the details of the argument. The reasoning is
analogous. Consider the car crash example from before, where \(S\)
stands for the defendant's speeding, \(C\) stands for the statement that
the crash caused neck injury, and \(E\) stands for the total evidence.
The plaintiff's hypothesis \(H_p\) is \(S\et C\). Suppose
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert S\et C}}{\pr{E \vert H_d}}>1\), or in other
words, the combined hypothesis \(S \et C\) has been established by
preponderance of the evidence. The question is whether the individual
hypotheses have been established by the same standard, specifically,
whether \(\frac{\pr{E \vert C}}{\pr{E\vert \neg C}} > 1\) and
\(\frac{\pr{E \vert S}}{\pr{E\vert \neg S}} > 1\). Focusing on a
specific defense hypothesis, \(\n S\et \n C\), the following
holds:\footnote{The total evidence \(E\) can be split into two items:
  \(s\) (evidence for claim \(S\)) and \(c\) (evidence for claim \(C\)).
  The inequality holds in \textsf{DAG1}, by replacing \(a\) and \(b\)
  with \(s\) and \(c\) and \(A\) and \(B\) with \(S\) and \(C\),
  because: \begin{align*}
   \frac{\pr{E \vert S\et C}}{\pr{E\vert \n S\et \n C}} & = \frac{\pr{s \et c \vert S\et C}}{\pr{ s \et c \vert \n S\et \n C}} \\
  & =^*  \frac{\pr{s \vert S}\pr{c \vert C}}{\pr{ s \vert \n S} \pr{c \vert  \n C}} \\
  & =  \frac{\pr{s \vert S}\pr{c}\pr{c \vert C}\pr{s}}{\pr{ s \vert \n S}\pr{c} \pr{c \vert  \n C}\pr{s}} \\
  & =^*  \frac{\pr{s \vert S}\pr{c \vert S}\pr{c \vert C}\pr{s\vert C}}{\pr{ s \vert \n S}\pr{c\vert \n S} \pr{c \vert  \n C}\pr{s\vert \n C}} \\
  & =  \frac{\pr{s \et c \vert S}\pr{ s\et c \vert C}}{\pr{ s \et c \vert \n S} \pr{s\et c \vert  \n C}} \\
  & =  \frac{\pr{E \vert S}\pr{E \vert C}}{\pr{E \vert \n S} \pr{E \vert  \n C}}
  \end{align*} The steps marked by \(*\) in the derivation holds because
  of the independencies in \textsf{DAG1}.}\raf{M: I think now this proof works, but it is restricted to DAG1 which is ok. Please double check.}
\begin{align}\label{eq:lr-multiplication-two}
1 < \frac{\pr{E \vert S\et C}}{\pr{E\vert \n S\et \n C}} & = \frac{\pr{E\vert S}\pr{E\vert C}}{\pr{ E \vert \n S}\pr{E \vert \n C}}   
\end{align}

\noindent Note that
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E\vert S}\pr{E\vert C}}{\pr{E \vert \n S}\pr{E\vert \n C}}\)
might be strictly greater than
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E\vert C}}{\pr{E\vert \n C}}\) or
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E\vert S}}{\pr{E\vert \n S}}\). It is possible that
\(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert S\et C}}{\pr{E \vert H_d}}\) is greater than
one, while either \(\frac{\pr{E \vert C}}{\pr{E\vert \neg C}}\) and
\(\frac{\pr{E \vert S}}{\pr{E\vert \neg S}}\) are not, say when they are
3 and 0.5, respectively. Once again, distribution fails.

A more general worry lingers, related to how this comparative likelihood
strategy is sensitive to the choice of the hypotheses. There might be
pairs of hypotheses that one wishes to compare, say \(H_1\) and \(H_2\),
such that \(\pr{E\vert H_1}\) is much (say, at least a few times) larger
than \(\pr{E\vert H_2}\). And yet, \(\pr{E \vert H_1}\) is still smaller
than \(\pr{E \vert \n H_1}\). In such circumstances, the comparative
likelihood strategy would be recommending the acceptance of \(H_1\)
(because it enjoys stronger evidential support than \(H_2\)) even
though, in absolute terms, the evidence supports the negation of \(H_1\)
to a greater extent.

\hypertarget{rejecting-the-conjunction-principle}{%
\section{Rejecting the conjunction
principle?}\label{rejecting-the-conjunction-principle}}

\label{sec:reject}

A number of strategies the legal probabilist can pursue to theorize
about the standard of proof have proven problematic: posterior
probability (Section \ref{sec:difficulty}), evidential strength (Section
\ref{sec:strength}), comparing posteriors or likelihoods (Section
\ref{sec:comparative}). It seems impossible, on probabilistic grounds,
to justify both directions of the conjunction principle. Of course,
these strategies do not exhaust the entire space of possibilities. The
legal probabilist could pursue other strategies, but the ones examined
so far provide good \textit{prima facie} evidence that perseverance will
not pay off. It is time to try a different approach.

Observe that the difficulty with conjunction would not arise without
endorsing the conjunction principle. Should legal probabilists simply
reject this principle? So far we have not challenged it, but it is time
to scrutinize it more closely. In this section, we provide an epistemic
argument and a legal argument to question the conjunction principle. At
the same time, we caution that merely rejecting the conjunction
principle will not automatically dissolve the difficulty with
conjunction. More work needs to be done. We take it on in the final
section.

\hypertarget{the-legal-argument}{%
\subsection{The legal argument}\label{the-legal-argument}}

Before moving further, it is worth asking what the law says about the
conjunction principle. The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that the
law does say not very much about it. We have been assuming that the law
agrees with the conjunction principle. At least, this is what Cohen
thought. Matters, however, are not so clear-cut. Looking at legal
practice, the conjunction principle is an uncertain principle at best.

There will be of course differences across countries. We cannot provide
a comprehensive analysis here. We shall be content with just a few
examples. The best place to look is how jury instructions are
formulated. Do they obey the conjunction principle? To some extent, they
do. For example, here are sample jury instructions about negligence in
civil cases:

\begin{quote}
A negligence claim has three elements:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  {[}Defendant{]} did not use ordinary care;
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  {[}Defendant's{]} failure to use ordinary care caused
  {[}Plaintiff's{]} harm; and
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  {[}Plaintiff{]} is entitled to damages as compensation for that harm.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
{[}Plaintiff{]} must prove each element by a preponderance of the
evidence---that each element is more likely so than not so. If
{[}Plaintiff{]} proves each element, your verdict must be for
{[}Plaintiff{]}. If {[}Plaintiff{]} does not prove each element, your
verdict must be for {[}Defendant{]}.\footnote{Standardized Civil Jury
  Instructions for the District of Columbia, Sec. 5.01 (Civil Jury
  Instructions, revised edition 2017).}
\end{quote}

\noindent The elements are explicitly separated and the standard of
proof is applied to each element separately. This seems to confirm the
conjunction principle. Other jury instructions are more ambiguous:

\begin{quote}
In order to find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, you must
decide it is more likely true than not true that:
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the defendant was negligent;
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  the plaintiff was harmed; and
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  the defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the
  plaintiff's harm.\footnote{Alaska Civil Pattern Jury Instructions,
    Sec. 3.01 (Civil Pattern Jury Instructions 2017).)}
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\noindent The elements are still separated, but the standard of proof
(`more likely than not') applies to the conjunction as a whole, not the
individual claims. This second set of jury instruction is at best
ambiguous between an atomistic reading (the standard of proof applies to
each claim separately) and a holistic reading (the standard of proof
applies to the conjunction). Only the atomistic reading would justify
the conjunction principle.

This quick survey of jury instructions gives us some reassurance that,
should we decide to reject the conjunction principle, we would not
violate a well-entrenched, indispensable legal principle.\footnote{For a
  detailed analysis of whether jury instructions obey the conjunction
  principle, see (Schwartz \& Sober, 2017). Their review of the
  empirical evidence shows a variety of formulations, not all compliant
  with the conjunction principle.}

\hypertarget{risk-accumulation}{%
\subsection{Risk accumulation}\label{risk-accumulation}}

Beside legal uncertainty about the tenability of the conjunction
principle, there are also independent theoretical reasons to question
the principle. In current discussions in epistemology about knowledge or
justification, a principle similar to the conjunction principle has been
contested, because it appears to deny the fact that risks of error
accumulate (Kowalewska, 2021). If one is reasonably sure about the truth
of each claim considered separately, one should not be equally
reasonably sure of their conjunction. You have checked each page of a
book and found no error. So, for each page, you are reasonably sure
there is no error. Having checked each page and found no error, can you
be equally reasonably sure that the book as a whole contains no error?
Not really. As the number of pages grow, it becomes virtually certain
that there is at least one error in the book you have overlooked,
although for each page you are reasonably sure there is no error
(Makinson, 1965). A reasonable doubt about the existence of an error, in
one page or another, creeps up as one considers more and more pages. The
same observation applies to other contexts, say product quality control.
You may be reasonably sure, for each product you checked, that it is
free from defects. But you cannot, on this basis alone, be equally
reasonably sure that all products you checked are free from defects.
Since the risks of error accumulate, you must have missed at least one
defective product.\footnote{The phenomenon of risk accumulation can also
  be formulated without using an explicitly probabilistic language. Say
  a claim is established if all reasonable defeaters have been ruled
  out. You have checked the quality of one product and it appears free
  from defects, and you have done the same with many other products.
  They all appear to be free from defects. In this sense, for each
  product, the claim `this product is free from defects' has been
  established, but the conjunctive claim `every product examined so far
  is free from defects' might not. After all, you know for sure you made
  at least one mistake. You know that from numerous past experiences.
  Your track record supplies a reasonable defeater to the claim `every
  product examined so far is free from defects' that is not a defeater
  for the individual claims of the form `this product is free from
  defects'.}

Risk accumulation challenges aggregation: even if the probability of
several claims, considered individually, is above a threshold \(t\),
their conjunction need not be above \(t\). It does not, however,
challenge distribution. If, all risks considered, you have good reasons
to accept a conjunction, no further risk is involved in accepting any of
the conjuncts separately. This is also mirrored by what happens with
probabilities. If the probability of the conjunction of several claims
is above \(t\), so is the probability of each individual claim. The
standard of proof in criminal or civil cases can be understood as a
criterion concerning the degree of risk that judicial decisions should
not exceed. If this understanding of the standard of proof is correct,
the phenomenon of risk accumulation would invalidate the conjunction
principle, specifically, it would invalidate aggregation. It would no
longer be correct to assume that, if each element is proven according to
the applicable standard, the case as a whole is proven according to the
same standard. And, in turn, if the conjunction principle no longer
holds, the conjunction paradox will disappear. Or will it? As we shall
now see, matters are not so straightforward.

\hypertarget{atomistic-and-holistic-approches}{%
\subsection{Atomistic and holistic
approches}\label{atomistic-and-holistic-approches}}

Suppose legal probabilists do away with the conjunction principle. Now
what? How should they define standards of proof? Two immediate options
come to mind, but neither is without problems.

Let's stipulate that, in order to establish the defendant's guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt (or civil liability by preponderance of the evidence
or clear and convincing evidence), the party making the accusation
should establish each claim, separately, to the requisite probability,
say at least .95 (or .5 in a civil case), without needing to establish
the conjunction to the requisite probability. Call this the
\textit{atomistic account}. On this view, the prosecution could be in a
position to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt without
establishing the conjunction of different claims with a sufficiently
high probability. This account would allow convictions in cases in which
the probability of the defendant's guilt is relatively low, just because
guilt is a conjunction of several independent claims that separately
satisfy the standard of proof. For example, if each constituent claim is
established with .95 probability, a composite claim consisting of five
subclaims---assuming, as usual, probabilistic independence between the
subclaims---would only be established with probability equal to .77, a
far cry from proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This is counterintuitve,
as it would allow convictions when the defendant is not very likely to
have committed the crime. A similar argument can be run for the civil
standard of proof `preponderance of the evidence.' Under the atomistic
account, the composite claim representing the case as a whole would
often be established with a probability below the required threshold.
The atomistic approach is a non-starter.

Another option is to require that the prosecution in a criminal case (or
the plaintiff in a civil case) establish the accusation as a whole---say
the conjunction of \(A\) and \(B\)---to the requisite probability. Call
this the \textit{holistic account}. This account is not without problems
either.

The standard that applies to one of the conjuncts would depend on what
has been achieved for the other conjuncts. For instance, assuming
independence, if \(\pr{A}\) is \(.96\), then \(\pr{B}\) must be at least
\(.99\) so that \(\pr{A\et B}\) is above a \(.95\) threshold. But if
\(\pr{A}\) is \(.9999\), then \(\pr{B}\) must only be slightly greater
than \(.95\) to reach the same threshold. Thus, the holistic account
might require that the elements of an accusation be proven to different
probabilities---and thus different standards---depending on how well
other claims have been established. This result runs counter to the
tacit assumption that each element should be established to the same
standard of proof (Urbaniak, 2019).

Fortunately, this challenge can be addressed. It is true that different
elements will be established with different probabilities, depending on
the probabilities of the other elements. But this follows from the fact
that the prosecution or the plaintiff may choose different strategies to
argue their case. They may decide that, since they have strong evidence
for one element and weaker evidence for the other, one element should be
established with a higher probability than the other. What matters is
that the case as a whole meets the required threshold, and this
objective can be achieved via different means. What will never happen is
that, while the case as a whole meets the threshold, one of the
constituent elements does not. As seen earlier, the probability of the
conjunction never exceeds the probability of one of the conjunct, or in
other words, distribution is never violated.

A more difficult challenge is the observation that the proof of
\(A\et B\) would impose a higher requirement on the separate
probabilities of the conjuncts. If the conjunction \(A\et B\) is to be
proven with at least .95 probability, the individual conjuncts should be
established with probability higher than .95. So the more constituent
claims, the higher the posterior probability for each claim needed for
the conjunction to meet the requisite probability threshold.

This challenge is best appreciated by running some numbers. Assume, for
the sake of illustration, the independence and equiprobability of the
constituent claims. If a composite claim consists of \(k\) individual
claims, these individual claims will have to be established with
probability of at least \(t^{1/k}\), where \(t\) is the threshold to be
applied to the composite
claim.\footnote{Let $p$ the probability of each constituent claim. To meet threshold $t$, the probability of the composite claim, $p^k$, should satisfy the constraint $p^k>t$, or in other words, $p>t^{1/k}$.}
For example, if there are ten constituent claims, they will have to be
proven with \(.5^{1/10}=.93\) even if the probability threshold is only
\(.5\). If the threshold is more stringent, as is appropriate in
criminal cases, say \(.95\), each individual claim will have to be
proven with near certainty. This would make the task extremely demanding
on the prosecution, if not downright impossible. If there are ten
constituent claims, they will have to be proven with
\(.95^{1/10}=.995\). So the plaintiff or the prosecution would face the
demanding task of establishing each element of the accusation beyond
what the standard of proof would seem to require.

We reached an impasse. Under the atomistic approach, the standard is too
lax because it allows for findings of liability when the defendant quite
likely committed no wrong. Under the holistic approach, the standard is
too demanding on the prosecution (or the plaintiff) because it requires
the individual claims to be established with extremely high
probabilities.

\hypertarget{not-asking-too-much}{%
\subsection{Not asking too much}\label{not-asking-too-much}}

Consider again the holistic approach. It is true that the individual
elements (the individual conjuncts) should be established with a higher
probability than the case as a whole (the conjunction). This would seem
to impose an unreasonably stringent burden of proof on the prosecution
or the plaintiff. But the burden might not be as unreasonable as it
appears at first. As Dawid (1987) pointed out, in one of the earliest
attempts to solve the conjunction paradox from a probabilistic
perspective, the prior probabilities of the conjuncts will also be
higher than the prior probability of their conjunction:

\begin{quote}
\dots it is not asking too much of the plaintiff to establish the case as a whole with a posterior probability exceeding one half, even though this means  that the several component issues must be established with much larger posterior probabilities; for the \textit{prior}  probabilities of the components will also be correspondingly larger, compared with that of their conjunction~[p.~97].
 \end{quote}

Dawid's proposal seems compelling. The prior probabilities of the
conjuncts are surely higher than the prior probability of the
conjunction. But why, exactly, is it `not asking too much' to establish
the individual conjuncts by a higher threshold than the case as a whole?
Perhaps, Dawid is pointing out that the \textit{difference} between
prior and posterior probabilities of the individual claims which the
evidence should bring about will not be unreasonably large. In other
words, Dawid might be recommending---as the rest of his paper
suggests---that the standard of proof not be understood solely in terms
of posterior probabilities. Measures of how strongly each claim
issupported by the evidence, such as the Bayes' factor or the likelihood
ratio, account for the difference between prior and posterior
probabilities. So, presumably, Dawid is recommending these measures as
better suited to formalize the standard of proof.

Now, as the reader will have realized, we have pursued Dawid's strategy
already in Section \ref{sec:strength}. This strategy can justify, on
purely probabilistic grounds, one direction of the conjunction
principle: aggregation. The evidential support---measured by the Bayes'
factor or the likelihood ratio---for the conjunction often exceeds the
individual support for (at least one of) the individual claims. This is
a success, especially because the failure of aggregation motivated
Cohen's formulation of the conjunction paradox. Unfortunately, we have
already seen that this strategy invalidates a previously unchallenged
direction of the conjunction principle: distribution.

\hypertarget{the-proposal}{%
\section{The proposal}\label{the-proposal}}

\label{sec:proposal}

Here is where we have gotten so far. There might be good reasons to
reject the conjunction principle, but rejecting it does not
automatically solve the difficulty with conjunction. We still need a
theory that explains how individual claims are combined, together with
the available evidence, to form more complex claims. The conjunction
principle provides a recipe---a very simple one at that---to combine
individual claims and form conjunctive claims. If that recipe is not
right, a good theory of the standard of proof should provide an
alternative recipe for combining individual claims.

Our proposal is inspired by the story model of adjudication (Pennington
\& Hastie, 1993; Wagenaar, Van Koppen, \& Crombag, 1993) and the
relative plausibility theory (Allen \& Pardo, 2019; Pardo \& Allen,
2008). It posits that prosecutors and plaintiffs should aim to establish
a unified narrative of what happened or explanation of the evidence, not
establish each individual element of wrongdoing separately. As we shall
see, any attempt to proceed in a piecemeal manner implicitly requires,
sooner or later, to weave the different elements together into a unified
whole. Our argument consists of two key ideas. First, the guilt or civil
liability of a defendant cannot be equated with a generic statement of
guilt or civil liability as defined in the law. The allegations against
the defendant facing trial should always be grounded in specific
details. Call this the specificity argument. Second, it is erroneous to
think of someone's guilt or civil liability as the mere conjunction of
separate claims. The separate claims must be coherently unified, not
just added up in a conjunction. Call this the unity argument.

\hypertarget{the-specificity-argument}{%
\subsection{The specificity argument}\label{the-specificity-argument}}

We start with the specificity argument. The probabilistic interpretation
of proof standards usually posits a threshold that applies to the
posterior probability of a \emph{generic} hypothesis, such as the
defendant is guilty of a crime, call it \(G\), or civilly liable, call
it \(L\). In criminal cases, the requirement is formulated as follows:
the evidence \(E\) presented at trial establishes guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt provided \(\pr{G \vert E}\) is above a suitable
threshold, say .95. The threshold is lower in civil trials. Civil
liability is proven by preponderance provided \(\pr{L \vert E}\) is
above a suitable threshold, say .5.

This formulation conflates two things. The act of wrongdoing as defined
in the applicable law is one thing. The way in which the wrongdoing is
established in court is another thing. The wrongdoing is defined in the
law in a generic manner and its definition is applicable across a class
of situations, whereas the way the wrongdoing is established in court is
specific to a unique situation and tailored to the individual defendant.
A prosecutor in a criminal case does not just establish that the
defendant assaulted the victim in one way or another, but rather, that
the defendant behaved in such and such a manner in this time and place,
and that the behavior in question fulfills the legal definition of
assault. The requirement of specificity is a consequence of the fact
that defendants have a right to be informed with sufficient detail and
be in a position to prepare a defense.\footnote{How the objective of
  specificity is actually achieved in trial proceedings is a difficult
  question. Different countries and jurisdictions may use different
  approaches, say, through the discovery process itself or a request of
  a bill of particulars. For example, at the end of the 19th century,
  the Supreme Court of Massachusetts wrote: `It is always open to the
  defendant to move the judge before whom the trial is had to order the
  prosecuting attorney to give a more particular description, in the
  nature of a specification or bill of particulars, of the acts on which
  he intends to rely, and to suspend the trial until this can be done;
  and such an order will be made whenever it appears to be necessary to
  enable the defendant to meet the charge against him, or to avoid
  danger of injustice.' (Commonwealth v. Sherman, 95 Mass. 248, 13 Allen
  248, 250, 1866).}

If this is right, the probabilistic interpretation of proof standards
should be revised. The generic statement that the defendant is guilty or
civilly liable should be replaced by a more fine-grained factual
hypothesis, call it \(H_p\), the hypothesis put forward by the
prosecutor (or the plaintiff in a civil case), for example, that the
defendant, given reasonably specific circumstances, approached the
victim, pushed and kicked the victim to the ground, and then run away.
Hypothesis \(H_p\) is a more precise description of what happened and
entails that the defendant committed the criminal offense or civil wrong
of which they are accused. In defining the standard of proof, instead of
saying---generically---that \(\pr{G \vert E}\) or \(\pr{L \vert E}\)
should be above a suitable threshold, a probabilistic interpretation
should read: civil or criminal liability is proven by the applicable
standard provided \(\Pr(H_p \vert E)\) is above a suitable threshold,
where \(H_p\) is a reasonably specific description of what happened
according to the prosecution or the plaintiff.

This revision may appear inconsequential, but it is not. It is the
revision we invoked to address the puzzles of naked statistical
evidence. Here is the gist of the argument. Consider the prisoner
hypothetical, a standard example of naked statistical evidence. The
naked statistics \(E_s\) make the prisoner on trial .99 likely to be
guilty, that is, \(\pr{G \vert E_s} =.99\). Given the known facts in the
prisoner hypothetical, it is \(.99\) likely that the prisoner on trial
was one of those who attacked and killed the guard. But this is a very
generic claim. It merely asserts that the prisoner was---with very high
probability---one of those who killed the guard, without specifying what
he did, what role he played in the attack, how he killed the guard, etc.
If the prosecution offered a more specific incriminating hypothesis
\(H_p\), the probability \(\pr{H_p \vert E_{s}}\) of this hypothesis
based on the naked statistical evidence \(E_s\) would be well below
\(.99\), even though \(\pr{G \vert E_s}=.99\). That the prisoner on
trial is most likely guilty is an artifact of the choice of a generic
hypothesis \(G\). When this hypothesis is made more specific---as should
be---this probability drops significantly. And the puzzle of naked
statistical evidence disappears. For a detailed articulation of this
argument, see Chapter 12.\footnote{An earlier version of this argument
  can be found in Di Bello (2013) and Di Bello (2021).}
\todo{REFERENCE TO EARLIER CHAPTER}

\hypertarget{the-unity-argument}{%
\subsection{The unity argument}\label{the-unity-argument}}

The specificity argument addresses the problem of naked statistical
evidence, but also provides the necessary background for addressing the
difficultly about conjunction. In the formulation of this difficulty,
not only are \(G\) and \(L\) understood as generic claims, but they are
also understood as \emph{mere conjunctions} of simpler claims that
correspond to the elements of wrongdoing in the applicable law. Since
the probability of a conjunction is often lower than the probability of
its conjuncts, the individual claims can be established with a suitably
high probability that meets the required threshold even though the
conjunction as a whole fails to meet the same threshold.

But here lies another confusion. It is one thing to establish that the
defendant committed \(A\) and \(B\), where the wrongdoing in question is
defined in the law as comprising two elements, \(A\) and \(B\). It is
another thing to establish that the defendant committed the wrong. The
conjunction paradox---in particular, the conjunction principle---assumes
that criminal or civil wrongdoings are mere collections of separate
elements. But the law is more nuanced. Legal definitions often impose a
structured unity on how the different elements relate to one another.
This unity could take many forms. It could be a temporal unity, the
unity that exists between a plan and its execution, or the unity between
the \textit{actus reus} and the \textit{mens rea} in a criminal offense.

But what if the law, at least in simple cases, did not impose any
structure onto the different elements of wrongdoing? In such cases, one
might argue, the conjunction principle---by which the different claims
are simply added to one another in a conjunction---would be adequate.
But even in simple cases in which the different elements of wrongdoing
are not structured in any explicitly way, it would still be a mistake to
follow the conjunction principle. To see why, consider a case in which
only two elements must be proven. Element 1: the defendant's conduct
caused a bodily injury to the victim. Element 2: the defendant's conduct
consisted in reckless driving. This offense is sometimes called
`vehicular assault.'\footnote{See, for example, Arizona Revised Statutes
  Title 13. Criminal Code § 13--1204 (`A person commits aggravated
  assault if the person commits assault \ldots{} under any of the
  following circumstances\ldots{} {[}such as{]} \ldots{} the person
  causes serious physical injury to another \ldots{} {[}or{]}\ldots{}
  the person uses a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.').} The two
elements each add novel information. It could be that the defendant's
driving caused an injury to victim, but the driving was not reckless, or
the driving was reckless, but no injury ensued. Neither element is
presupposed by the other. Crucially, here the law does not impose any
explicit structure between the elements. But---we will now see---the
unity argument still applies at a conceptual level.

Let's think about how to establish the claim of reckless driving that
caused injury to the victim. One option is to offer a detailed
reconstruction of what happened. The reconstruction could go something
like this. The defendant was driving above the speed limit, veering left
and right. The defendant's reached a school crosswalk when children were
getting out of school. The defendant hit a child on the crosswalk who
was then pushed against a light pole on the sidewalk incurring a head
injury. Suppose this story is supported by several testimonies by other
children, people standing around, police officers, paramedics. There is
plenty of supporting evidence as the incident occurred in the middle of
the day. Taken at face value, this story does establish both elements:
reckless driving and cause of injury. Parts of the story are relevant
for element 1 (reckless driving) and other parts are relevant for
element 2 (cause of injury). The two cannot be neatly separated,
however. Still, what is crucial is that the different parts of the story
are part of the same episode, the same unit of wrongdoing.

Could the prosecutor prove vehicular assault in a piecemeal manner?
Suppose the prosecutor attempted to do that, by establishing, first,
that the defendant drove recklessly, and second---\emph{separately from
the first element}---that the defendant's action caused injury. As noted
before in the specificity argument, it is not enough to establish that
the defendant drove recklessly at some point in time somewhere. Nor is
it enough to establish that the defendant's action caused injury. The
prosecutor should offer a specific story detailing what happened, a
story relevant for the first element and a story relevant for the second
element. Say this expectation of specificity is met. Suppose the
prosecutor did not just establish generic element 1 and generic element
2, but rather, a reasonably detailed story for ech element. Would that
be enough? It wouldn't. Even if each element---that is, each story
associated with each element---was established by the required standard,
there would still be something missing here.

The prosecutor should establish that the two elements are part of the
same unity of wrongdoing. It must be \emph{this} reckless driving that
caused \emph{this} injury. So, under the piecemeal approach, the
prosecutor would be tasked with establishing three claims: (a) the
defendant, in some well-specified circumstances, was driving reckless;
(b) the defendant, in some well-specified circumstances, caused injury
to the victim; and (c) the well-specified circumstances in (a) and (b)
are part of the same episode. But once (c) is established, the
prosecutor would have effectively established the charge by the required
standard in accordance with the holistic approach. The prosecutor did
not only establish each separate element (two separate stories) but also
combine the two elements (the two stories) together. Once the piecemeal
approach is pursued to its logical conclusion, it coincides with the
holistic approach.\footnote{We should be clear that it is not enough for
  the prosecutor or plaintiff to provide well-specified narrative in
  support of their allegations, even when they are well-supported by the
  evidence. When the two narratives are combined into one narrative, its
  probability could well be below the threshold. If we only require that
  each element-specific narrative be proven, a defendant could be found
  criminally or civilly liable even though it is unlikely that they
  committed the alleged wrongful act. This counter-intuitive result is
  similar to the one that arose with the atomistic approach.}

Let's summarize the unity argument in schematic form. If the prosecutor
or the plaintiff is expected to establish claim \(A\) and \(B\) by the
required standard, what the law actually requires---even in terms of the
piecemeal approach---is (a) to establish \(A\); (b) to establish \(B\);
and (c) to establish \(A\) and \(B\) are part of the same unit of
wrongdoing by the required standard. Item (c) is often implicit, which
leaves the impression that the law only requires to establish (a) and
(b) separately. Interestingly, (c) entails (a) and (b). In fact, (c)
amounts to establishing a unified story, narrative or theory about what
happened. Such a narrative should be subsumed under the different
elements of wrongdoing as defined in the law. The piecemeal approach and
the holistic approach, therefore, converge.

To be sure, not all wrongful acts, in civil or criminal cases, require
the prosecutor or the plaintiff to establish a unified
\emph{spatio-temporal} narrative. It might not be necessary to show that
all elements of an offense occurred at the same point in time or in
close succession one after the other. Some wrongful acts may consist of
a pattern of acts that stretches for several days, months or even years.
There may be temporal and spatial gaps that cannot not be filled. We
consider several of these examples in our discussion of naked
statistical evidence in Chapter 12. \todo{SEE PREVIOUS CHAPTER} Be that
as it may, an accusation of wrongdoing in a criminal or civil case
should still have a degree of cohesive unity. The acts and occurrences
that constitute the wrongdoing should belong to the same wrongful act.
It is this unity which the plaintiff and the prosecution must establish
when they make their case. One way to establish this unity is by
providing a unifying narrative, but this need not be the only way. A
unifying `theory' of what happened or a cohesive `explanation' of the
evidence could all deliver the structured unity that is needed to
establish the defendant's liability.

\hypertarget{the-conjuction-principle-trivialized}{%
\subsection{The conjuction principle
trivialized}\label{the-conjuction-principle-trivialized}}

What do the specificity and unity argument tell us about the difficulty
with conjunction? The maxim that prosecutors and plaintiffs should aim
to establish a well-specified, unified account of the wrongdoing ends up
trivializing the conjunction principle and ultimately dissolving the
difficulty about conjunction. How so? Suppose the prosecutor established
a narrative \(N\) by a very high probability, say above the required
threshold for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Denote the elements of
wrongdoing by \(EL_1, EL_2, \dots\). Then,
\[\text{ $\pr{EL_1\wedge EL_1 \wedge \dots \wedge EL_k \vert N}=\pr{EL_i \vert N} = 1$ for any $i=\{1, 2, ..., k\}$}.\]
\noindent

Both directions of the conjunction principle, aggregation and
distribution, are now trivially satisfied. By conditioning on the
narrative \(N\), each individual claim has a probability of one and thus
their conjunction also has a probability of one. The conjunction
principle is reduced to a deductive check that the elements of the
wrongdoing follow from the narrative put forward. The narrative,
however, has a probability short of one, up to whatever value is
required to meet the governing standard of proof. The standard applies
to the narrative as a whole, and only indirectly---via a deductive
check---to the individual elements. This trivialization of the
conjunction principle is perhaps unsurprising. If anything, it mirrors
the fact that no lawyer has ever been concerned with the reliability of
inference rules such conjunction elimination and conjunction
introduction.

Admittedly, this trivialization does not vindicate the conjunction
principle as stated at the beginning of this chapter in any way.
But---we have argued---the conjunction principle is not the right
principle to combine simple, individual claims into more complex claims.
Mere conjunctive addition does not get us very far in complex legal
cases. There is a key distinction between the narrative \(N\) (or
theory, explanation) and the mere conjunction
\(EL_1\wedge EL_1 \wedge \dots \wedge EL_k\) of the elements of
wrongdoing. The narrative describes one way among many of instantiating
the conjunction. The claims that constitute a narrative (or unified
theory, explanation) need not map neatly onto the elements of the
wrongdoing. The narrative will comprise claims about the evidence itself
and how the evidence supports other claims in the narrative, say that
witnesses were standing around when the defendant's car hit the child.
The narrative (or theory, explanation) will not only comprise a
description of what happened but also of how we know it is what
happened.

If more structure is needed than the mere conjunctive addition of the
elements of wrongdoing, the conjunction principle should be rejected and
replaced by a more nuanced method to aggregate evidence and construct
complex claims. We have gestured at what this method should look
like---roughly, it relies on Bayesian networks. Here is the general
idea. The individual claims or hypotheses to be established and the
supporting pieces of evidence are represented as nodes in a Bayesian
network. Some nodes will count as `evidence nodes' and others as `claim
nodes' or `hypothesis nodes'. A narrative (or theory, explanation) is
then a suitable collection of evidence nodes and hypothesis nodes that
are connected to one another by relationships of conditional
probabilistic dependence (represented by arrows in the Bayesian
network), meant to capture causal or evidential relationships. This web
of dependencies affords the narrative its unity and coherence. More
details on this point are in Part III of the book devoted to the
evaluation and assessment of evidence, especially Chapter 7 and 8 on
Bayesian networks.\todo{REF TO OTHER CHAPTERS}

\hypertarget{probability-specificity-and-completeness}{%
\subsection{Probability, specificity and
completeness}\label{probability-specificity-and-completeness}}

We conclude this chapter with a few general observations. To start, the
distinction between narrative and the mere conjunction of elements
matters for how we should understand the standard of proof. Other things
being equal, the conjunction is more probable on the evidence than the
narrative, and each conjunct even more probable. But this does not mean
that the mere conjunction is established by a higher standard of proof
than the narrative. As we argued in Chapter 12 on naked statistical
evidence, \todo{REFERENCE TO EARLIER CHAPTERS} a highly probable
narrative that nevertheless lacks the desired degree of specificity will
fail to meet the standard of proof. By contrast, a more specific
narrative that is otherwise less probable than the mere conjunction
might well meet the standard. On this account, the standard of proof is
sensitive to two variables: (1) the posterior probability of the
proposed narrative (or theory, explanation) given the evidence presented
at trial; and (2) the degree of specificity and unity of the narrative
(or theory, explanation).

But a unified narrative (theory, or explanation) may still fall short if
it contains gaps---that is, if there are propositions about which the
narrative should make a commitment but instead remains neutral about
them. The narrative may also have incomplete evidence if it contains
evidential gaps---that it, if there are evidence-bearing propositions
whose probability is non-negligible (given what is assumed to be true in
the narrative), but are nevertheless not included in the evidence nodes.
So another variable worth adding to posterior probability and
specificity is (3) the completeness of the evidence presented at trial.
Could the probability of someone's guilt be extremely high just because
the evidence presented is one-sided and missing crucial pieces of
information? It surely can. If the probability of liability is high
because the evidence is partial, liability was not proven beyond a
reasonable doubt (and perhaps not even by a lower standard such as
preponderance of the evidence).\footnote{It is a matter of dispute
  whether knowledge about missing or partial evidence should affect the
  posterior probability. After all, if we know that some evidence is
  missing, shouldn't we revise the assessment of the posterior
  probability of the hypothesis? The problem is that the content of the
  missing evidence is unknown. The missing evidence might increase or
  decrease this probability. We cannot know that without knowing the
  content of the evidence. If we knew how the missing evidence would
  affect our judgment about the defendant's guilt, the evidence would no
  longer be---strictly speaking---missing. That is why we prefer to add
  the completeness of the evidence as a third variable to consider. For
  a recent case in which missing evidence was alleged as a reason for
  reversing a verdict of guilt, see Johnson v.~Premo, 315 Oregon Appeal
  1 (2021).}

On our proposal, the standard of proof is informed by three maxims:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The probability of the defendant's liability should be sufficiently
  (or reasonably) high;
\item
  The narrative (or theory, explanation) of the defendant's liability
  should be sufficiently (or reasonably) specific; and
\item
  The supporting evidence should be sufficiently (or reasonably)
  complete.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent  At this point, the reader might wonder: are we ultimately
giving up on legal probabilism? We are only giving up on
\emph{traditional} legal probabilism. Even though ideas such as
specificity, unity and completeness of the evidence cannot be formalized
in the language of posterior probability alone, they can be formalized
as properties of Bayesian networks.\footnote{A more detailed
  articulation of the ideas of narrative unity and coherence, factual
  specificity, and evidential gaps is carried out in Chapter 10. An
  early development of this approach can be found in Urbaniak (2018).}
\todo{REF TO OTHER CHAPTERS}

Probability theory plays also a second-order role in our argument.
Specifically, our analysis of the standard of proof---which combines
three ingredients: posterior probability, specificity and
completeness---can be evaluated at the meta-level using concepts from
probability theory. Suppose we wish to compare a trial system that
convicts defendants on the basis of claims that are generic but highly
probable, as opposed to a trial system that convicts defendants on the
basis of claims that are more specific but less probable. Which trial
system will make fewer mistakes---fewer false convictions and false
acquittals---in the long run? The answer is not obvious. But the
question can be made precise in the language of probability. The
question concerns the diagnostic properties of the two trial systems,
such as their rate of false positives and false negatives. We examine
this question in Chapter 16. We conduct a simulation study of the impact
of properties of narratives (as defined in Bayesian networks) on their
expected accuracy. \todo{REFERENCE TO LATER CHAPTER} To anticipate, we
argue that more specific claims are liable to more extensive adversarial
scrutiny than generic claims. The more specific someone's claim, the
more liable to be attacked. At the same time, if a specific claim
resists adversarial scrutiny, it becomes more firmly established than a
less specific claim that was not scrutinized. So specificity plays an
accuracy-conducive role even though more specific claims are, other
things being equal, less probable than more generic claims.\footnote{The
  argument in this chapter is sympathetic with a point made by Karl
  Popper (2002) about science: `Science does not aim, primarily, at high
  probabilities. It aims at a high informative content, well backed by
  experience. But a hypothesis may be very probable simply because it
  tells us nothing, or very little. A high degree of probability is
  therefore not an indication of goodness' (416, Appendix *IX).}
