Finally, here is a somewhat abstract, yet important approach  to confirmation measures due to [@Heckerman1988axiomatic], which constitutes a fairly strong motivation to use likelihood ratio. Suppose you have background information $e$, and consider a hypothesis $H$ when you obtain a piece of evidence $E$. A belief update, $U(H, E, e)$, together with your prior stance of $H$, should determine your posterior belief in $H$. If we denote conditional belief in $H$ given $E$, without assuming it's probabilistic yet, as $H\vert E$, this means that there should be an $f$  such that:
\begin{align*}
H \vert Ee & = f(U(H,E,e), H \vert e)
\end{align*}


\noindent where, on this approach, $H \vert Ee, U(H,E,e),$ and $H \vert e$, are all real numbers, and $f$ is required to be continuous in both arguments and monotonically increasing when the other is held constant.
