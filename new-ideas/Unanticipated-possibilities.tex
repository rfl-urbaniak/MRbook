\subsection{Basic idea}\label{basic-idea}}

How does the Bayesian framework deal with the problem of unanticipated
possibilities?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There seems to be two sides to this problem:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
  \item
    The space of possibilities could get larger, say, first one
    considers only two suspects, Michael and Nero, and then a third
    suspect, Tito, becomes plausible. The priors of M and N were
    initially 50:50 (or 75:25, whatever), and T got nothing. Actually, T
    was not in the algebra to begin with. But, now T is in the algebra
    and gets a non-zero probability. How can this be handled in the
    Bayesian framework?
  \item
    The space of possibilities become more fine-grained. Consider a DNA
    evidence case. At first, one of the hypothesis is that the defendant
    is the source of the crime stain. But as the investigation proceeds,
    it becomes clear that it makes a difference whether the defendant is
    the source of the crime stains on the pillow or on the sofa.
    Perhaps, the stain on the pillow were left innocently, but the
    stains on sofa were left by the perpetrator. So the space of
    possibilities becomes more fine-grained.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Not sure if the two items above are actually different, but they seem
  to be. In the first, the possibilities expand. In the second, the
  possibilities become more fine-grained. The first can be represented
  by adding a possible world, while the second, by making the
  equivalence classes among possible world more fine grained.
\item
  We need to be careful about what we are trying to represent here. Say
  we are trying to represent what is going on in the jurors' or judges'
  minds as they hear evidence in the trial and they process the
  evidence. We are trying to give a plausible picture of the processing
  of the evidence and hypotheses at stake.
\item
  Are we trying to give an empirically adequate picture or just a
  philosophically or formal plausible picture?
\end{itemize}

Quotations from Allen's The Nature of Juridical Proof: Probability as a
Tool in Plausible Reasoning:

\begin{quote}
The decision-makers in all legal systems must learn about the issue being litigated, whether this is through serial hearings as in some continental systems or concentrated trials in the American tradition ... in no system does the fact-finder have substantial knowledge about the case until evidence is presented. Obviously. That means, though, that it is literally impossible to form a probability space of mutually exclusive hypotheses, to assign them initial probabilities. (p. 138)

Some of you may think that I overstate the case and that the mutually exclusive hypotheses are
obvious: guilt or innocence or liability or no liability ... Guilt, innocence, liability and no liability are not factual hypotheses; they are legal conclusions that are applied to characterise the implications of the facts that are found. It should be obvious that one cannot condition 'guilt' on some evidence without going through a factual proposition that is the actual object of proof. (p. 138)

Complicating matters further is the \textbf{emergence of new theories} ... Like society itself, the
litigation process is dynamic, not static, and frequently new theories will emerge. When they do, the
probability space must be reconfigured. It is thus pointless to configure the probability space even if it
could be done at some point prior to receiving all the evidence and hearing all the arguments. (p. 139)

And finally, the \textbf{spectre of Old Evidence} raises its head. After the theories of the parties are finally identified and the logical space defined, initial assignments of probability must be made in order for Bayes' Theorem to be employed. But those initial assignments of probability will obviously include
consideration of the trial evidence, as well as pre-existing knowledge of the fact-finder. Once the
probability space is determined and initial probabilities assigned, all the trial evidence is old evidence
that has already been accommodated. There is no work for Bayes' Theorem to do. (p. 139)

What, then, are the \textbf{tasks for the future}? ... For the legal
analysts, there are two issues that should preoccupy us going forward. The first is the perennial problem
of constructing methods to \textbf{decrease the probability that unreliable evidence is being provided} by
purported experts and scientists ... that means engaging with the underlying forensic science to ensure that appropriate methodologies are employed and that the evidence offered at trial does not overleap what those methodologies can deliver. The second is the more fundamental problem noted above of \textbf{integrating that evidence with the rest of the evidence} in the case ... What that means in turn, of course, is to flesh out the nature of rational thought ... The discrete question to be addressed is the implications of rational thought writ large for the legal system. (p. 141)

\hypertarget{possible-worlds-equivalence-classes}{%
\subsection{Possible worlds / equivalence
classes}\label{possible-worlds-equivalence-classes}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We start with all possible worlds \(S\). This is the entirety of the
  logical space. Each world is a complete description of how things
  could have been.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Language approach. Each world is a maximally consistent set of
    sentences. The language here should be assumed the most informative
    language possible, or at least, a very expressive language, say
    English. Anything that cannot be expressed in that language is left
    out and will never be under consideration.
  \item
    Model theoretic approach. Note sure.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  At some point during trial, a common ground \(\mathcal{G}=(G, \sim)\)
  is formed---it becomes clear what is at issue, what questions are
  being asked, what is not at issue, what is disputed, what is agreed
  upon, etc. This common ground, formally, has two dimensions:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    some possible worlds are removed, i.e.~all possible worlds that make
    true propositions that are demonstrable false, assumed to be false
    or simply not considered at issue, so we should only focus on a
    subset of \(S\), that is, \(G\subseteq S\)
  \item
    an equivalence class \(\sim\) is induced over the remaining set
    \(G\) of possible worlds. This equivalence class fixes how fine
    grained the discussion is going to be (at the level of
    source/not-sourse or pillow/sofa, etc.). Worlds that are in the same
    equivalence classes are indistinguishable and thus treated as
    equivalent. Notation: let \([G]_\sim\) be the set of all equivalence
    classes induced by \(\sim\) in \(G\).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The probability measure \(\pr{}\) applies within the common ground as
  defined in points (a) and (b) above. So if \([G]_\sim\) is the set of
  all equivalence classes induced by \(\sim\) in \(G\), any probability
  measure \(\pr{}\) is a function from all subsets of \([G]_\sim\) into
  \([0, 1]\), that is, \(\pr{}: \wp([G]_\sim)\to [0,1]\).
\item
  Two side notes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Bayesian updating, in the traditional sense, occurs within the
    common ground \(\mathcal{G}=(G, \sim)\). Presumably, since the
    common ground is fairly limited in terms of how much is at under
    dispute---the litigant at trial cannot disc ussu everything---the
    application os probability to these limited domain is not
    unfeasible. To be discussed further. This might address Allen's
    complexity concerns about Bayesianism.
  \item
    Suppose what is being disputed is just M (=Michael did it) versus N
    (=Nero did it). Then, M and N form an exhaustive and exclusive pair.
    Which means that \(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert M}}{\pr{E \ vert N}}\) is
    the same same thing as
    \(\nicefrac{\pr{E \vert M}}{\pr{E \ vert \neg M}}\). This is true,
    however, relative to a fixed common ground. It is not true in
    general since \(M\) and \(N\) dod nt cover teh entire logical space
    \(S\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Unanticipated possibilities may arise (a) either because possible
  worlds that were taught to be false, assumed to be false or simply
  excluded become relevant---for example, when Tito becomes a suspect
  besides Nero and Michael---(b) or because the equivalence class become
  more fine-grained---for example, when the focus become pillow/sofa and
  not simply source/non-source.
\item
  There seems to be two dynamic updates going on here:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    dynamic update within a fixed common ground, this the classical
    Bayesian update
  \item
    meta-level dynamic update about what the common ground
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Both updates are plausible. For judges and jurors may be asked (a) to
  assess evidence relative to a fixed common ground or (b) assess the
  evidence relative to a new common ground (say, new sets of
  hypothesis).
\item
  The formal framework should be able to go back and forth between the
  two level (simply Bayesian updates within the common ground and
  meta-level update about the common ground itself). There should bridge
  rule or constraints that allow to go from level to another without
  loss of information.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    What we want to avoid is that, once a new common ground is formed,
    the evidence assessment is redone completely afresh from scratch.
    The epistemic work done previously in asessing evidence relative to
    the old common ground shouod be retained if possible.
  \item
    Note that we speak as though the evidence is kept the same in going
    from one common ground to the next. This makes sense intuitively.
    How can we make plausible sense of this sameness of evidence across
    common grounds? Strictly speaking the evidence is not the same.
    Since the evidence is a propositions of some kind (=set of possible
    world), any change in common ground will trigger a change in the
    evidence as a proposition. So we need to specify conditions by which
    the evidence stays the same.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  One question here is whether we should do this syntactically or
  model-theoretically. The problem of doing it model-theoretically are
  things like logical omniscience.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{bayesian-network-updating-and-comparison}{%
\subsection{Bayesian network updating and
comparison}\label{bayesian-network-updating-and-comparison}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The Bayesian network need not be incompatible with the possible world
  approach. The two might be complementary.
\item
  Rafal identified two dynamic processes:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
  \item
    Once a Bayesian network is constructed, and all probabilities are
    assigned, Bayesian updating takes place within the network.
  \item
    A meta-level updating that may consist in (b1) refining the Bayesian
    network itself by adding arrows and nodes or (b2) comparing a
    Bayesian network to another Bayesian network.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  How does the meta-level network updating (refining of a network or
  comparison across networks) relate to the meta-level updating of the
  possible world approach outlined earlier?
\end{itemize}
