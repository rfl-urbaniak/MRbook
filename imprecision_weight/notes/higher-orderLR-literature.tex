\section{Purpose of this document}\label{purpose-of-this-document}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Summarize existing forensic science literature on higher order LR
\item
  Outline the structure of the paper/chapter on higher-order legal
  probabilism.
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure of paper/chapter}\label{structure-of-paperchapter}}

As I see it, the argument of the paper should be structured around three
key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{First}: The debate among forensic scientists and proposals on
  the table
\item
  \textbf{Second}: The higher order approach as a novel proposal, how it
  works, etc.
\item
  \textbf{Third}: Why the higher order approach is better than existing
  approaches
\end{itemize}

This is standard structure for any scholarly paper. Below each point is
developed more precisely.

\hypertarget{charitable-reconstruction-of-the-debate-in-the-literature}{%
\subsection{Charitable reconstruction of the debate in the
literature}\label{charitable-reconstruction-of-the-debate-in-the-literature}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The paper should begin with a \textbf{charitable reconstruction} of
  the debate in the forensic science literature. (See, e.g., the 2016
  special issue of \emph{Science and Justice}, ``Special issue on
  measuring and reporting the precision of forensic likelihood ratios'',
  edited by G.S. Morrison. All the papers are in a special folder called
  2016ScienceJustruce-SpecIssue-LR etc.) The Lund slides try to do that,
  but -- in retrospect -- they do not do succeed.
\item
  Here is a charitable reconstruction:
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everybody agrees that LRs (as averages, expectations) do not convey
    all the underlying uncertainty. There is uncertainty originating
    with the sample size (call it, \emph{data uncertainty}) and there is
    uncertainty about the model assumptions (call it, \emph{model
    uncertainty}). So clearly, LRs do not capture data uncertainty or
    model uncertainty. Call these additional forms of uncertainty
    \emph{meta-uncertainty}. (An interesting philosophy paper that might
    be good to reference on meta-uncertainty is ``Meta-uncertainty and
    the proof paradoxes'' by Katie Steele and Mark Colyvan,
    Philosophical Studies, in particular sections 4 and 5.)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everybody agrees that meta-uncertainty should be communicated by the
    experts to the fact-finders besides the first-order uncertainty
    captured by LRs.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The question is, how should this meta-uncertainty be conveyed? What
    is the best way to convey it? This is where the disagreement starts.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Many proposals are on the table: describe data collection and model
    assumptions (Taroni/Bozza); place confidence intervals over LRs;
    model possible differences in terms of robustness (Biederman); etc.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{21}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The interval approach is criticized because LRs are not parameters
    to be estimated.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-higher-order-approach}{%
\subsection{The higher order approach}\label{the-higher-order-approach}}

The next section of the paper should outline the higher approach as a
novel answer to the question of how to model (at least part of) the
meta-uncertainty that cannot be modeled by LRs alone. Some key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{mathematics} should be clear. Are higher order
  probabilities well-behaved probabilities? Is the mathematics all
  working properly? How do we show that? (The paper by Philip Dawid
  ``Forensic likelihood ratio: Statistical problems and pitfalls'' in
  the 2016 special issue might be a good starting point)
\item
  How much of the meta-uncertainty is \textbf{captured} by distribution
  over probabilities and how much of the meta-uncertainty is still
  \textbf{left out} of the formal model?
\item
  Parallels with the debate between precise/imprecise probabilism in
  philosophy. (Not sure if this is really necessary though.)
\item
  Good to show that everything that can be done with LRs (e.g.~combine
  them) can be done using higher order LRs and higher order Bayesian
  networks. So the higher order approach combines reasoning about
  first-order uncertainty with reaosning about meta-uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comparing-higher-order-approach-to-existing-approaches}{%
\subsection{Comparing higher order approach to existing
approaches}\label{comparing-higher-order-approach-to-existing-approaches}}

In what way is the higher order approach different and better than other
existing approaches for conveying meta-uncertainty to fact-finders?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  One key argument in favor of the higher-order approach concerns how
  different pieces of evidence (with different meta-uncertainties) can
  be combined. No one of the existing approaches has anything to say
  about how to combine different pieces and keep track of the
  meta-uncertainty. For example, it is not clear how the resilience
  approach or the interval approach could do that correctly (explain
  why).
\item
  Respond to objections against the higher order approach, e.g.~higher
  order probabilities do not exist or make no sense mathematically.
\end{itemize}
