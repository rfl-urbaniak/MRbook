\section{Purpose of this document}\label{purpose-of-this-document}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Summarize comments received at Lund conference in June 2023 on the
  presentatin about Higher Order Legal Probabilism. To make sense of
  these comments, it is best to check out the slides of the
  presentation.
\item
  Outline the structure of the paper on higher-order legal probabilism.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{alex-biederman}{%
\subsection{Alex Biederman}\label{alex-biederman}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is a difference between a RMP based on a small database and a
  RMP based on a larger database. But that difference is best modeled by
  the \textbf{resilience} or \textbf{robustness} of the RMP: a RMP based
  on a larger database will be more resilient/robust in light of future
  data compared to a RMP based on a smaller database. We do not need to
  go higher-order. Everything can be done using the notion of
  resilience/robustness. (Note that this same point was made by Brian
  Skyrms in his well-known paper on resilience). \textbf{Challenge}:
  what theoretical or practical advantages does the higher-order
  approach have above and beyond the notion of resilience or robustness?
\item
  It is odd to place a probability on top of a probability. There cannot
  be uncertainty about uncertainty. More specifically, in the DNA
  database example, there is uncertainty about the \textbf{proportion},
  but not about the RMP probability itself. We might have a more or less
  precise estimate of the proportion (which is a \textbf{parameter}),
  but it makes no sense to talk about uncertainty about a probability.
\item
  In the slides (see presentation slides), \(\theta\) is not a
  probability. It is a proportion. It is okay to place a distribution
  over a proportion. It makes no sense to place a distribution over a
  probability. Hence, there is a mistake in the slides because
  \(\theta\) must be a proportion, not a probability.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{marjan-sjerps}{%
\subsection{Marjan Sjerps}\label{marjan-sjerps}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  She agrees with the general line of argument, at least in practice.
\item
  However, she thinks that the \textbf{mathematics} is not correct (for
  reasons similar to Alex Biederman). A probability cannot be placed on
  top of a probability. This is mathematically incorrect. One needs to
  show that this higher-order probability is a probability (it satisfies
  the axioms, it behaves as intended, etc.).
\item
  Hierarchical Bayesian models use hyper-parameters and distributions
  over them, so they use distributions over parameters and distributions
  over hyper parameters, but they never use distributions over
  probabilities. So the higher order approach isn't really Bayesian. It
  is okay to place distributions over parameters (or hyper parameters),
  but not over probabilities themselves.
\item
  \emph{Challenge}: How can we ensure that the mathematics of
  higher-order probabilities behaves as intended?
\item
  It is unclear whether \(\theta\) is a parameter or a probability in
  the slides. It should be a parameter, not a probability.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{franco-taroni-and-silvia-bozza}{%
\subsection{Franco Taroni and Silvia
Bozza}\label{franco-taroni-and-silvia-bozza}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is correct to say that the fact-finders should not make decisions
  on just the RMP alone. RMP must be accompanied by information about
  the \textbf{model}, the data collection and any other information that
  may be useful.
\item
  Using higher-order probabilities to capture this additional
  information is not necessarily the best formal tool, especially given
  the technical and mathematical problems with higher-order
  probabilities.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{christian-dahlman}{%
\subsection{Christian Dahlman}\label{christian-dahlman}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  He agrees with the general line of argument, but has problem with the
  use of \textbf{weight} in one of the slides.
\item
  One the slides said that, if a RMP is based on little data, then when
  this item is combined with other evidence this aspect should be taken
  into account, for example, by seeking more evidence or by giving more
  weight to other evidence. (see slides 26 ``If \(\theta\) is small but
  its distribution spread out, this is a good reason for the triers of
  fact to seek more information or give more weight to other
  incriminating evidence''). This is not correct.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{colin-aitken}{%
\subsection{Colin Aitken}\label{colin-aitken}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If we think of \(\theta\) as a parameter, we are simply talking about
  uncertainty about a parameter and standard statistical tools apply:
  confidence intervals, etc.
\item
  But the issue is not about the uncertainty of \(\theta\) as a
  parameter, the issue is whether we should place a probability over a
  probability, and that is not possible.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structure-of-paper}{%
\section{Structure of paper}\label{structure-of-paper}}

As I see it, the argument of the paper should be structured around three
key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{First}: The debate among forensic scientists and proposals on
  the table
\item
  \textbf{Second}: The higher order approach as a novel proposal, how it
  works, etc.
\item
  \textbf{Third}: Why the higher order approach is better than existing
  approaches
\end{itemize}

This is standard structure for any scholarly paper. Below each point is
developed more precisely.

\hypertarget{charitable-reconstruction-of-the-debate-in-the-literature}{%
\subsection{Charitable reconstruction of the debate in the
literature}\label{charitable-reconstruction-of-the-debate-in-the-literature}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The paper should begin with a \textbf{charitable reconstruction} of
  the debate in the forensic science literature. (See, e.g., the 2016
  special issue of \emph{Science and Justice}, ``Special issue on
  measuring and reporting the precision of forensic likelihood ratios'',
  edited by G.S. Morrison.) The Lund slides try to do that, but -- in
  retrospect -- they do not do succeed.
\item
  Here is a charitable reconstruction:
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everybody agrees that LRs (as averages, expectations) do not convey
    all the underlying uncertainty. There is uncertainty originating
    with the sample size (call it, \emph{data uncertainty}) and there is
    uncertainty about the model assumptions (call it, \emph{model
    uncertainty}). So clearly, LRs do not capture data uncertainty or
    model uncertainty. Call these additional forms of uncertainty
    \emph{meta-uncertainty}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everybody agrees that meta-uncertainty should be communicated by the
    experts to the fact-finders besides the first-order uncertainty
    captured by LRs.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The question is, how should this meta-uncertainty be conveyed? What
    is the best way to convey it? This is where the disagreement starts.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Many proposals are on the table: describe data collection and model
    assumptions (Taroni/Bozza); place confidence intervals over LRs;
    model possible differences in terms of robustness (Biederman); etc.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
  \setcounter{enumi}{21}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The interval approach is criticized because LRs are not parameters
    to be estimated.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-higher-order-approach}{%
\subsection{The higher order approach}\label{the-higher-order-approach}}

The next section of the paper should outline the higher approach as a
novel answer to the question of how to model (at least part of) the
meta-uncertainty that cannot be modeled by LRs alone. Some key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{mathematics} should be clear. Are higher order
  probabilities well-behaved probabilities? Is the mathematics all
  working properly? How do we show that?
\item
  How much of the meta-uncertainty is \textbf{captured} by distribution
  over probabilities and how much of the meta-uncertainty is still
  \textbf{left out} of the formal model?
\item
  Parallels with the debate between precise/imprecise probabilism in
  philosophy. (Not sure if this is really necessary though.)
\item
  Good to show that everything that can be done with LRs (e.g.~combine
  them) can be done using higher order LRs and higher order Bayesian
  networks. So the higher order approach combines reasoning about
  first-order uncertainty with reaosning about meta-uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comparing-higher-order-approach-to-existing-approaches}{%
\subsection{Comparing higher order approach to existing
approaches}\label{comparing-higher-order-approach-to-existing-approaches}}

In what way is the higher order approach different and better than other
existing approaches for conveying meta-uncertainty to fact-finders?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  One key argument in favor of the higher-order approach concerns how
  different pieces of evidence (with different meta-uncertainties) can
  be combined. No one of the existing approaches has anything to say
  about how to combine different pieces and keep track of the
  meta-uncertainty. For example, it is not clear how the resilience
  approach or the interval approach could do that correctly (explain
  why).
\item
  Respond to objections against the higher order approach, e.g.~higher
  order probabilities do not exist or make no sense mathematically.
\end{itemize}
