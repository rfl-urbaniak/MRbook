\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\label{sec:introduction}

Precise probabilism (PP) has it that a rational agent's (RA) uncertainty
is to be represented as a single probability measure. The view has been
criticized on the ground that RA's degrees of belief are not
appropriately evidence-responsive, especially when evidence is scant.
Accordingly, an alternative view---imprecise probabilism (IP)---has been
proposed, on which RA's uncertainty is to be represented by a set of
probability measures, rather than a unique one.

Unfortunately, this view runs into problems as well. (1) It still does
not seem to be sufficiently evidence-responsive, (2) it is claimed to
get certain comparative probability judgments wrong, (3) it seems to be
unable to model learning when the starting point is complete lack of
information, and (4) notoriously there exist no inaccuracy measure of an
imprecise credal stance if the measure is to satisfy certain
straightforward formal conditions.

\todo{Think about including synergy}

The main claim of this paper is that the way forward is to use
higher-order probabilities to represen't RA's uncertainty in the
relevant cases. The key idea is that uncertainty is not a
single-dimensional thing to be mapped on a single one-dimensional scale
like a real line and that it's the whole shape of the whole distribution
over parameter values that should be taken under consideration. This
guiding idea can be used to resolve many problems and philosophical
puzzles raised in the debate between PP and IP. Moreover, Bayesian
probabilistic programming already provides a fairly reliable
implementation framework of this approach.

\hypertarget{precise-probabilism}{%
\subsection{Precise probabilism}\label{precise-probabilism}}

Precise probabilism (\textsf{PP}) holds that a rational agent's
uncertainty about a hypothesis is to be represented as a single, precise
probability measure. This is an elegant and simple theory. But
representing our uncertainty about a proposition in terms of a single,
precise probability runs into a number of difficulties. Precise
probabilism---arguably---fails to capture an important dimension of how
our fallible beliefs reflect the evidence we have (or have not)
obtained. A couple of stylized examples should make the point clear. For
the sake of simplicity, we will use examples featuring coins.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{No evidence v. fair coin}
You are about to toss a coin, but have no evidence 
whatsoever about its bias. You are completely ignorant. 
Compare this to the situation in which you know, 
based on overwhelming evidence, that the coin is fair. 
\end{quote}

\noindent On precise probabilism, both scenarios are represented by
assigning a probability of .5 to the outcome \emph{heads}. If you are
completely ignorant, the principle of insufficient evidence suggests
that you assign .5 to both outcomes. Similarly, if you know for sure the
coin is fair, assigning .5 seems the best way to quantify the
uncertainty about the outcome. The agent's evidence in the two scenario
is quite different, but precise probabilities fail to capture this
difference.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Learning from ignorance}
You toss a coin with unknown bias. You toss it 10 times and observe \emph{heads} 5 times. Suppose you toss it further and observe 50 \emph{heads} in 100 tosses. 
\end{quote}

\noindent Since the coin initially had unknown bias, you should
presumably assign a probability of .5 to both outcomes if you stick with
\textsf{PP}. After the 10 tosses, you end up again with an estimate of
.5. You must have learned something, but whatever that is, it is not
modeled by precise probabilities. When you toss the coin 100 times and
observe 50 heads, you learn something new as well. But your precise
probability assessment will again be .5.

These examples suggest that precise probabilism is not appropriately
responsive to evidence when it comes to representing what RA justifiedly
believes of has learned. It ends up assigning the same probability in
situations in which one's evidence is quite different: when no evidence
is available about the coin's bias; when there is little evidence that
the coin is fair (say, after only 10 tosses); and when there is strong
evidence that the coin is fair (say, after 100 tosses). The general
problem is, precise probability captures the value around which your
uncertainty should be centered, but fails to capture how centered it
should be given the evidence.\footnote{In fact, analogous problems arise
  even if we do not start with complete lack of evidence; if RA
  initially weakly believes that the coin is .6 biased towards heads, as
  she might still learn more, by confirming her belief by tossing the
  coin repeatedly and observing, say, 60 heads in 100 tosses---but this
  improvement is not mirrored in the precise probability she will assign
  to heads.}

Precise probabilism, it has been argued, fails also to account for cases
in which an agent remains undecided even after some additional evidence
has been obtained. Imagine RA doesn't know what the bias of the coin is,
which PP represents as \(\pr(H)= .5\). Then she learns that the bias
towards heads has been slightly increased by .001 (in the philosophical
literature, this is called \emph{sweetening}. Intuitively, this might
still leave RA equally undecided when it comes to betting on \(H\). that
would've been fair even if the actual chance of \(H\) was .5 and not
.001. The same sweetening, however, should make RA bet on \(H\) if their
original lack of information was in fact correctly captured as a precise
credence.

\hypertarget{imprecise-probabilism}{%
\subsection{Imprecise probabilism}\label{imprecise-probabilism}}

What if we give up the assumption that probability assignments should be
precise? Imprecise probabilism (\textsf{IP}) holds that an agent's
credal stance towards a hypothesis is to be represented by means of a
\emph{set of probability measures}, typically called a representor
\(\mathbb{P}\), rather than a single measure \(\mathsf{P}\). The
representor should include all and only those probability measures which
are compatible with the evidence. For instance, if an agent knows that
the coin is fair, their credal state would be represented by the
singleton set \(\{\mathsf{P}\}\), where \(\mathsf{P}\) is a probability
measure which assigns \(.5\) to \emph{heads}. If, on the other hand, the
agent knows nothing about the coin's bias, their credal state would be
represented by the set of all probabilistic measures, since none of them
is excluded by the available evidence. Note that the set of probability
measures does not represent admissible options that the agent could
legitimately pick from. Rather, the agent's credal state is essentially
imprecise and should be represented by means of the entire set of
probability measures.\footnote{For the development of imprecise
  probabilism, see Keynes (1921); Levi (1974); Gärdenfors \& Sahlin
  (1982); Kaplan (1968); Joyce (2005); Fraassen (2006); Sturgeon (2008);
  Walley (1991). S. Bradley (2019) is a good source of further
  references. Imprecise probabilism shares some similarities with what
  we might call \textbf{interval probabilism} (Kyburg, 1961; Kyburg Jr
  \& Teng, 2001). On interval probabilism, precise probabilities are
  replaced by intervals of probabilities. On imprecise probabilism,
  instead, precise probabilities are replaced by sets of probabilities.
  This makes imprecise probabilism more general, since the probabilities
  of a proposition in the representor set do not have to form a closed
  interval. In what follows, we will ignore interval probabilism, as
  intervals do not contain probabilistic information sufficient to guide
  reasoning with multiple items of evidence.}

Imprecise probabilism, at least \emph{prima facie}, offers a
straightforward picture of learning from evidence, that is a natural
extension of the classical Bayesian approach. When faced with new
evidence \(E\) between time \(t_0\) and \(t_1\), the representor set
should be updated point-wise, running the standard Bayesian updating on
each probability measure in the representor:
\begin{align*} \label{eq:updateRepresentor}
\mathbb{P}_{t_1} = \{\mathsf{P}_{t_1}\vert \exists\, {\mathsf{P}_{t_0} \!\in  \mathbb{P}_{t_0}}\,\, \forall\, {H}\,\, \left[\mathsf{P}_{t_1}(H)=\mathsf{P}_{t_0}(H \vert E)\right] \}.
\end{align*}

\noindent The hope is that, if we start with a range of probabilities
that is not extremely wide, point-wise learning will behave
appropriately. For instance, if we start with a prior probability of
\emph{heads} equal to .4 or .6, then those measure should be updated to
something closer to \(.5\) once we learn that a given coin has already
been tossed ten times with the observed number of heads equal 5 (call
this evidence \(E\)). This would mean that if the initial range of
values was \([.4,.6]\) the posterior range of values should be more
narrow.

But even this seemingly straightforward piece of reasoning is hard to
model without using densities. For to calculate
\(\pr{\s{bias} = k \vert E}\) we need to calculate
\(\pr{E \vert \s{bias} = k }\pr{\s{bias} = k}\) and divide it by
\(\pr{E} = \pr{E \vert \s{bias} = k }\pr{\s{bias = k}} + \pr{E \vert \s{bias} \neq k }\pr{ \s{bias} \neq k}\).
The tricky part is obtaining \(\pr{\s{bias} = k}\) or
\(\pr{ \s{bias} \neq k}\) in a principled manner without explicitly
going second-order, without estimating the parameter value and without
using beta distributions.

The situation is even more difficult if we start with complete lack of
knowledge, as imprecise probabilism runs into the problem of
\textbf{belief inertia} (Levi, 1980). Say you start tossing a coin
knowing nothing about its bias. The range of possibilities is \([0,1]\).
After a few tosses, if you observed at least one tail and one heads, you
can exclude the measures assigning 0 or 1 to \emph{heads}. But what else
have you learned? If you are to update your representor set point-wise,
you will end up with the same representor set. Consequently, the edges
of your resulting interval will remain the same. In the end, it is not
clear how you are supposed to learn anything if you start from complete
ignorance.

Here's another example from Rinard (2013). Either all the marbles in the
urn are green (\(H_1\)), or exactly one tenth of the marbles are green
(\(H_2\)). Your initial credence is complete uncertainty with interval
\([0,1]\) associated with each hypothesis. Then you learn that a marble
drawn at random from the urn is green (\(E\)). After conditionalizing
each function in your representor on this evidence, you end up with the
the same spread of values for \(H_1\) that you had before learning
\(E\), and no matter how many marbles are sampled from the urn and found
to be green.

Some downplay the problem of belief inertia. They insist that vacuous
priors should not be used and that imprecise probabilism gives the right
results when the priors are non-vacuous. After all, if you started with
knowing truly nothing, then perhaps it is right to conclude that you
will never learn anything. Another strategy is to say that, in a state
of complete ignorance, a special updating rule should be
deployed.\footnote{Elkin (2017) suggests the rule of
  \emph{credal set replacement} that recommends that upon receiving
  evidence the agent should drop measures rendered implausible, and add
  all non-extreme plausible probability measures. This, however, is
  tricky. One needs a separate account of what makes a distribution
  plausible or not, as well as a principled account of why one should
  use a separate special update rule when starting with complete
  ignorance.} But no matter what we think about belief inertia, other
problems plague imprecise probabilism. Three problems are particularly
pressing.

One problem is that \textbf{imprecise probabilism fails to capture
intuitions we have about evidence and uncertainty in a number of
scenarios.} Consider this example:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Even v. uneven bias:}
 You have two coins and you know, for sure, that the probability of getting heads is .4, if you toss one coin, and .6, if you toss the other coin. But you do not know which is which. You pick one of the two at random and toss it.  Contrast this with an uneven case. You have four coins and you know that three of them have bias $.4$ and one of them has bias $.6$. You pick a coin at random and plan to toss it. You should be three times more confident that the probability of getting heads is .4. rather than .6.
\end{quote}

\noindent The first situation can be easily represented by imprecise
probabilism. The representor would contain two probability measures, one
that assigns .4. and the other that assigns .6 to the hypothesis `this
coin lands heads'. But imprecise probabilism cannot represent the second
situation, at least not without moving to higher-order probabilities or
assigning probabilities to chance hypotheses, in which case it is no
longer clear whether the object-level imprecision does any heavy
lifting.\footnote{Other scenarios can be constructed in which imprecise
  probabilism fails to capture distinctive intuitions about evidence and
  uncertainty; see, for example, (Rinard, 2013). Suppose you know of two
  urns, \textsf{GREEN} and \textsf{MYSTERY}. You are certain
  \textsf{GREEN} contains only green marbles, but have no information
  about \textsf{MYSTERY}. A marble will be drawn at random from each.
  You should be certain that the marble drawn from \textsf{GREEN} will
  be green (\(G\)), and you should be more confident about this than
  about the proposition that the marble from \textsf{MYSTERY} will be
  green (\(M\)). In line with how lack of information is to be
  represented on \textsf{IP}, for each \(r\in [0,1]\) your representor
  contains a \(\mathsf{P}\) with \(\pr{M}=r\). But then, it also
  contains one with \(\pr{M}=1\). This means that it is not the case
  that for any probability measure \(\mathsf{P}\) in your representor,
  \(\mathsf{P}(G) > \mathsf{P}(M)\), that is, it is not the case that RA
  is more confident of \(G\) than of \(M\). This is highly
  counter-intuitive.}

Second, besides descriptive inadequacy, imprecise probabilism fases a
foundational problem. It arises when we attempt to measure the accuracy
of a representor set of probability measures. Workable \emph{scoring
rules} exist for measuring the accuracy of a single, precise credence
function, such as the Brier score. These rules measure the distance
between one's credence function (or probability measure) and the actual
value. A requirement of scoring rules is that they be \emph{proper}: any
agent will score their own credence function to be more accurate than
every other credence function. After all, if an agent thought a
different credence was more accurate, they should switch to it. Proper
scoring rules are then used to formulate accuracy-based arguments for
precise probabilism. These arguments show (roughly) that, if your
precise credence follows the axioms of probability theory, no other
credence is going to be more accurate than yours whatever the facts are.
Can the same be done for imprecise probabilism? It seems not.
Impossibility theorems demonstrate that \textbf{no proper scoring rules
are available for representor sets}. So, as many have noted, the
prospects for an accuracy-based argument for imprecise probabilism look
dim (Campbell-Moore, 2020; Mayo-Wilson \& Wheeler, 2016; Schoenfield,
2017; Seidenfeld, Schervish, \& Kadane, 2012). Moreover, as shown by
Schoenfield (2017), if an accuracy measure satisfies certain plausible
formal constraints, it will never strictly recommend an imprecise
stance, as for any imprecise stance there will be a precise one with at
least the same accuracy.

The third problem with imprecise probabilism is that, \textbf{degenerate
cases aside, it is hard to make sense of the notion of an IP agent
learning that a probabilistic measure is incompatible with the
evidence.} Recall that the probability measures allowed in a representor
set are supposed to be only those compatible with the agent's evidence.
The idea is that thanks to this feature, imprecise credal stances are
evidence-responsive in a way precise probabilistic stances are not. But
how, exactly, does the evidence exclude probability measures?

This is not a mathematical question: mathematically (S. Bradley, 2012),
evidential constraints are easy to model. They can take the form, for
example, of the \emph{evidence of chances} \(\{ \mathsf{P}(X) = x\}\) or
\(\mathsf{P}(X) \in [x,y]\), or \emph{structural constraints} such as
``\(X\) and \(Y\) are independent'' or ``\(X\) is more likely than
\(Y\).'' While it is clear that these constraints are something that an
agent can come to accept if offered such information by an expert to
which the agent completely defers, it is not trivial to explain how
non-testimonial evidence can result in such constraints for an epistemic
agent that functions as IP proposes.

Most of the examples in the literature start with the assumption that
the agent is told by a believable source that the chances are
such-and-such, or that the experimental set-up is such that the agent
knows that such and such structural constraint is satisfied. But,
besides ideal circumstances, it is unclear how an agent could come to
accept such structural constraints upon observation. The chain of
testimonial evidence has to end somewhere.

Admittedly, there are straightforward degenerate cases: if you see the
outcome of a coin toss to be heads, you reject the measure with
\(\mathsf{P}(H)=0\), and similarly for tails. Another class of cases
might arise if you are randomly drawing objects from a finite set where
the real frequencies are already known, because this finite set has been
inspected. But such extreme cases aside, what else? Mere consistency
constraint wouldn't get the agent very far in the game of excluding
probability measures, as way too many probability measures are strictly
speaking still consistent with the observations for evidence to result
in epistemic progress.\^{}{[} Bradley suggests that ``statistical
evidence might inform {[}evidential{]} constraints {[}\dots and that
evidence{]} of causes might inform structural constraints''
{[}125-126{]}. This, however, is not a clear account of how exactly this
should proceed. One suggestion might be that once a statistical
significance threshold is selected, a given set of observations with a
selection of background modeling assumptions yields a credible interval.
But this is to admit that to reach such constraints, we already have to
start with a second-order approach, and drop information about the
densities, focusing only on the intervals obtained with fixed margins of
errors. But as we will be insisting, if you have the information about
densities to start with, there is no clear advantage to going imprecise
instead, and there are multiple problems associated with this move.
Moreover, such moves require a choice of an error margin, which is
extra-epistemic, and it is not clear what advantage there is to use
extra-epistemic considerations of this sort to drop information
contained in densities.\footnote{Relatedly, in forensic evidence
  evaluation even scholars who disagree about the value of going
  higher-order agree that interval reporting is problematic, as the
  choice of a limit or uncertainty level is rather arbitrary (Sjerps et
  al., 2015; Taroni, Bozza, Biedermann, \& Aitken, 2015).}

\hypertarget{higher-order-probabilism}{%
\section{Higher-order probabilism}\label{higher-order-probabilism}}

There is, however, a view in the neighborhood that fares better: a
higher-order perspective. In fact, some of the comments by the
proponents of imprecise probabilism tend to go in this direction. For
instance, Bradley compares the measures in a representor to committee
members, each voting on a particular issue, say the true bias of a coin.
As they acquire more evidence, the committee members will often converge
on a specific chance hypothesis. He writes (S. Bradley, 2012, p. 157):

\begin{quote}
\dots the committee members are ''bunching up''. Whatever measure you put over the set of probability functions---whatever ''second order probability'' you use---the ''mass'' of this measure gets more and more concentrated around the true chance hypothesis'.
\end{quote}

\noindent Note, however, that such bunching up cannot be modeled by
imprecise probabilism alone.\footnote{Bradley seems to be aware of that,
  which would explain the use of scare quotes: when he talks about the
  option of using second-order probabilities in decision theory, he
  insists that `there is no justification for saying that there is more
  of your representor here or there.'
  \textasciitilde{[}p.\textasciitilde195{]}}

In a similar vein, Joyce (2005), in a paper defending imprecise
probabilism, attempts to explicate something that imprecise probabilism
was advertised to handle better than precise probabilism: weight of
evidence. But in fact, the explication uses a density over chance
hypotheses to account for the notion of evidential weight and
conceptualizes the weight of evidence as an increase of concentration of
smaller subsets of chance hypotheses, without any reference to
representors in the explication of the notion of weight.

The idea that one should use higher-order probabilities has also been
suggested by critics of imprecise probabilism. For example, Carr (2020)
argues that sometimes evidence requires uncertainty about what credences
to have. Carr, however, does not articulate this suggestion more fully,
does not develop it formally, and does not explain how her approach
would fare against the difficulties affecting precise ad imprecise
probabilism. This is the key goal of this paper.

The underlying idea of the higher-order approach we propose is that
\textbf{uncertainty is not a single-dimensional thing to be mapped on a
single one-dimensional scale such as a real line. It is the whole shape
of the whole distribution over parameter values that should be taken
under consideration.}\footnote{Bradley admits this much (S. Bradley,
  2012, p. 90), and so does Konek (Konek, 2013, p. 59). For instance,
  Konek disagrees with: (1) \(X\) is more probable than \(Y\) just in
  case \(p(X)>p(Y)\), (2) \(D\) positively supports \(H\) if
  \(p_D(H)> p(H)\), or (3) \(A\) is preferable to \(B\) just in case the
  expected utility of \(A\) w.r.t. \(p\) is larger than that of \(B\).}
From this perspective, when an agent is asked about their credal stance
towards \(X\), they can refuse to summarize it in terms of a point value
\(\mathsf{P}(X)\). They can instead express their credal stance in terms
of a probability (density) distribution \(f_x\) treating
\(\mathsf{P}(X)\) as a random variable. To be sure, an agent's credal
state toward \(X\) could sometimes be usefully represented by the
expectation, especially when the agent is quite confident about the
probability of a given proposition.

Generally, expectation is defined as \(\int_{0}^{1} x f(x) \, dx\)--in
the context of our approach here, we can think of \(x\) as the
objectively appropriate/justified degree of belief in a given
proposition, and of \(f\) as the density representing the agent's
uncertainty about \(x\). Perhaps, such an expectation can be used as the
precise, object-level credence in the proposition itself, where \(f\) is
the probability density over possible object-level probability values.
But this need not always be the case. If the probability density \(f\)
is not sufficiently concentrated around a single value, a one-point
summary might fail to do justice to the nuances of the agent's credal
state. This approach lines up with common practice in Bayesian
statistics, where the primary role of uncertainty representation is
assigned to the whole distribution. Summaries such as the mean, mode
standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, or highest posterior
density intervals are only succinct ways for representing the
uncertainty of a given scenario.

For example, consider again the scenario in which the agent knows that
the bias of the coin is either .4 or .6 but the former is three times
more likely. Representing the agent's credal state with the expectation
\(\mathsf{P}(X) = .75 \times .4 + .25 \times .6 = .45\) would fail to
capture an important feature of RA's belief---that she believes the two
biases to be of hugely different plausibilities, and that she in fact is
certain that the bias is \emph{not} .75.

This higher-order approach as a technical devise is not very surprising.
Bayesian probabilistic programming languages embrace the well-known idea
that parameters can be stacked and depend on each other in more or less
complicated manners.\todo{Cite PP without tears here} What is however
surprising is that while the technical devise has been available, it
hasn't been implemented to model agent's uncertainty, and by the same
token to address all the challenging scenarios we discussed so far.

Once we allow more expressive power in this fashion, we obtain rather
straightforwardly obtain more honest representations of RA's credal
states, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:evidenceResponse}. In particular,
the scenario in which the two biases of the coin are not equally
likely---which imprecise probabilism cannot model---can be easily
modeled within high-order probabilism by assigning different
probabilities to the two biases.

\caption{Examples of higher-order distributions for a few  scenarios problematic for both precise and imprecise probabilism.}
\label{fig:evidenceResponse}
\end{figure}

Besides its flexibility in modelling uncertainty, higher-order
probabilism does not fall prey to belief inertia. Consider a situation
in which you have no idea about the bias of a coin. So you start with a
uniform density over \([0,1]\) as your prior. By using binomial
probabilities as likelihoods, observing any non-zero number of heads
will exclude 0 and observing any non-zero number of tails will exclude 1
from the basis of the posterior. The posterior distribution will become
more centered around the parameter estimate as the observations come in.

Figure \ref{fig:intertia2} shows---starting with a uniform prior
distribution--- how the posterior distribution changes after successive
observations of heads, heads again, and then tails.\footnote{More
  generally, learning about frequencies, assuming independence and
  constant probability for all the observations, is modeled the Bayes
  way. You start with some prior density \(p\) over the parameter
  values. If you start with complete lack of information, \(p\) should
  be uniform. Then, you observe the data \(D\) which is the number of
  successes \(s\) in a certain number of observations \(n\). For each
  particular possible value \(\theta\) of the parameter, the probability
  of \(D\) conditional on \(\theta\) follows the binomial distribution.
  The probability of \(D\) is obtained by integration. That is:
  \begin{align*}
  p(\theta \vert D) & = \frac{p(D\vert \theta)p(\theta)}{p(D)}\\
  & = \frac{\theta^s (1-\theta)^{(n - s)}p(\theta)}{\int (\theta')^s (1-\theta')^{(n - s)}p(\theta')\,\, d\theta'}.
  \end{align*}}

\caption{As observations of heads, heads and tails come in, extreme parameter values drop out of the picture and the posterior is shaped by the evidence.}
\label{fig:intertia2}
\end{figure}

A further advantage of high-order probabilism over imprecise probabilism
is that the prospects for accuracy-based arguments are not foreclosed.
This is a significant shortcoming of imprecise probabilism, especially
because such arguments exist for precise probabilism. One can show that
there exist proper scoring rules for higher-order probabilism. These
rules can then be used to formulate accuracy-based arguments. Another
interesting feature of the framework is that the point made by
Schoenfield against imprecise probabilism does not apply: there are
cases in which accuracy considerations recommend an imprecise stance
(that is, a multi-modal distribution) over a precise one. We will get
back to these issues when we talk about accuracy. \todo{Ref to section}

All in all, higher-order probabilism outperforms both precise and
imprecise probabilism, at the descriptive as well as the normative
level. From a descriptive standpoint, higher-order probabilism can
easily model a variety of scenarios that cannot be adequately modeled by
the other versions of probabilism. From a normative standpoint, accuracy
maximization may sometimes recommend that a rational agent represent
their credal state with a distribution over probability values rather
than a precise probability

\section{A more concrete example}\label{a-more-concrete-example}}

A defendant in a criminal case may face multiple items of incriminating
evidence whose strength can at least sometimes be assessed using
probabilities. For example, consider a murder case in which the police
recover trace evidence that matches the defendant. Hair found at the
crime scene matches the defendant's hair (call this evidence
\textsf{hair}). In addition, the defendant owns a dog whose fur matches
the dog fur found in a carpet wrapped around one of the bodies (call
this evidence \textsf{dog}).\footnote{The hair evidence and the dog fur
  evidence are stylized after two items of evidence in the notorious
  1981 Wayne Williams case (Deadman, 1984b, 1984a).} The two matches
suggest that the defendant (and the defendant's dog) must be the source
of the crime traces (call this hypothesis \(\mathsf{source}\)). But how
strong is this evidence, really? What are the fact-finders to make of
it?

The standard story among legal probabilists goes something like this. To
evaluate the strength of the two items of match evidence, we must find
the value of the likelihood ratio:
\[\frac{\pr{\s{dog}\wedge \s{hair} \vert \s{source}}}{\pr{\s{dog}\wedge \s{hair} \vert \neg \s{source}}}\]
For simplicity, the numerator can be equated to one. To fill in the
denominator, an expert provides the relevant random match probabilities.
Suppose the expert testifies that the probability of a random person's
hair matching the reference sample is about 0.0253, and the probability
of a random dog's hair matching the reference sample happens to be about
the same, 0.0256.\footnote{Probabilities have been slightly but not
  unrealistically modified to be closer to each other in order to make a
  conceptual point. The original probabilities were 1/100 for the dog
  fur, and 29/1148 for Wayne Williams' hair. We modified the actual
  reported probabilities slightly to emphasize the point that we will
  elaborate further on: the same first-order probabilities, even when
  they sound precise, may come with different degrees of second-order
  uncertainty.} Presumably, the two matches are independent lines of
evidence. In other words, their random match probabilities must be
independent of each other conditional on the source hypothesis. Then, to
evaluate the overall impact of the evidence on the source hypothesis,
you calculate: \begin{align*}
\pr{\s{dog}\wedge \s{hair} \vert \neg \s{source}} & = \pr{\s{dog} \vert \neg \s{source}} \times \pr{\s{hair} \vert \neg \s{source}} \\
& =  0.0252613 \times  0.025641 = \ensuremath{6.4772626\times 10^{-4}}
\end{align*} This is a very low number. Two such random matches would be
quite a coincidence. Following our advice from Chapter 5, the expert
facilitates your understanding of how this low number should be
interpreted. They show you how the items of match evidence change the
probability of the source hypothesis given a range of possible priors
(Figure \ref{fig:impactOfPoint}). The posterior of .99 is reached as
soon as the prior is higher than 0.061.\footnote{These calculations
  assume that the probability of a match if the suspect and the
  suspect's dog are the sources is one.} While perhaps not sufficient
for outright belief in the source hypothesis, the evidence seems
extremely strong: a minor additional piece of evidence could make the
case against the defendant overwhelming.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{imprecision_philosophical_paper2_files/figure-latex/impactOfPoint4-1} \end{center}
\caption{Impact of dog fur and human hair evidence on the prior, point estimates.}
\label{fig:impactOfPoint}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, this analysis leaves out something crucial. You reflect
on what you have been told and ask the expert: how can you know the
random match probabilities with such precision? Shouldn't we also be
mindful of the uncertainty that may affect these numbers? The expert
agrees, and tells you that in fact the random match probability for the
hair evidence is based on 29 matches found in a database of size 1148,
while the random match probability for the dog evidence is based on
finding two matches in a reference database of size 78.

The expert's answer makes apparent that the precise random match
probabilities do not tell the whole story. Perhaps, the information
about sample sizes is good enough and now you know how to use the
evidence properly.\footnote{This is what, effectively, CITE TARONI seem
  to suggest when they insist the fact-finders should be simply given
  point estimates and information about the study set-up, such as sample
  size. As will transpire, we disagree.} But if you are like most human
beings, you can't. What to do, then?\\
\todo{added this bit to draw attention to this aspect of the Taroni debate, to come back to this}

You ask the expert for guidance: what are reasonable ranges of the
random match probabilities? What are the worst-case and best-case
scenarios? The expert responds with 99\% credible
intervals---specifically, starting with uniform priors, the ranges of
the random match probabilities are (.015,.037) for hair evidence and
(.002, .103) for fur evidence.\footnote{Roughly, the 99\% credible
  interval is the narrowest interval to which the expert thinks the true
  parameter belongs with probability .99. For a discussion of what
  credible intervals are, how they differ from confidence intervals, and
  why confidence intervals should not be used, see Chapter 3.} With this
information, you redo your calculations using the upper bounds of the
two intervals: \(.037\) and \(.103\). The rationale for choosing the
upper bounds is that these numbers result in random match probabilities
that are most favorable to the defendant. Your new calculation yields
the following: \begin{align*}
\mathsf{P}(\s{dog}\wedge \s{hair} \vert \neg \s{source})   & =  .037 \times .103 =.003811.
\end{align*} This number is around 5.88 times greater than the original
estimate. Now the prior probability of the source hypothesis needs to be
higher than 0.274 for the posterior probability to be above .99 (Figure
\ref{fig:impactOfCharitable}). So you are no longer convinced that the
two items of match evidence are strongly incriminating.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{imprecision_philosophical_paper2_files/figure-latex/FigcharitableImpact75-1} \end{center}

\caption{Impact of dog fur and human hair evidence on the prior, charitable reading.}
\label{fig:impactOfCharitable}
\end{figure}

This result is puzzling. Are the two items of match evidence strongly
incriminating evidence (as you initially thought) or somewhat weaker (as
the new calculation suggests)? For one thing, using precise random match
probabilities might be too unfavorable toward the defendant. On the
other hand, your new assessment of the evidence based on the upper
bounds might be too \emph{favorable} toward them. Is there a middle way
that avoids overestimating and underestimating the strength of the
evidence?

To see what this middle path looks like, we should reconsider the
calculations you just did. You made an important blunder: you assumed
that because the worst-case probability for one event is \(x\) and the
worst-case probability for another independent event is \(y\), the
worst-case probability for their conjunction is \(xy\). But this
conclusion does not follow if the margin of error (credible interval) is
fixed. The intuitive reason is simple: just because the probability of
an extreme (or larger absolute) value \(x\) for one variable \(X\) is
.01, and so it is for the value \(y\) of another independent variable
\(Y\), it does not follow that the probability that those two
independent variables take values \(x\) and \(y\) simultaneously is the
same. This probability is actually much smaller. The interval
presentation instead of doing us good led us into error.

In general, it is impossible to calculate the credible interval for the
joint distribution based solely on the individual credible intervals
corresponding to the individual events. We need additional information:
the distributions that were used to calculate the intervals for the
probabilities of the individual events. In our example, if you
additionally knew, for instance, that the expert used beta distributions
(as, arguably, they should in this context), you could in principle
calculate the 99\% credible interval for the joint distribution. It
usually will not be the same as whatever the results of multiplication
of individual interval edges, and it is unlikely that a human
fact-finder would be able to correctly run such calculations in their
head even if they knew the functional form of the distributions used.
\footnote{Also, in principle, in more complex contexts, we need further
  information about how the items of evidence are related if we cannot
  take them to be independent.} So providing the fact-finder with
individual intervals, even if further information about the
distributions is provided, might easily mislead.\footnote{Investigation
  of the extent to which the individual interval presentation is
  misleading would be an interesting psychological study.}
\todo{Can you google to see if there is any such study?}

As it turns out, given the reported sample sizes, the 99\% credible
interval for the probability
\(\mathsf{P}(\s{dog}\wedge \s{hair} \vert \neg \s{source})\) is
\((0.000023, 0.002760)\). \todo{the fn was repetitive, compare to fn 5}

The upper bound of this interval would then require the prior
probability of the source hypothesis to be above .215 for the posterior
to be above .99. On this interpretation, the two items of match evidence
are still not quite as strong as you initially thought, but stronger
than what your second calculation indicated.

Still, the interval approach---even the corrected version just
outlined---suffers from a more general problem. Working with intervals
might be useful if the underlying distributions are fairly symmetrical.
But in our case, they might not be. For instance, Figure
\ref{fig:densities} depicts beta densities for dog fur and human hair,
together with sampling-approximated density for the joint evidence. The
distribution for the joint evidence is not symmetric. If you were only
informed about the edges of the interval, you would be oblivious to the
fact that the most likely value (and the bulk of the distribution,
really) does not simply lie in the middle between the edges. Just
because the parameter lies in an interval with some posterior
probability, it does not mean that the ranges near the edges of the
interval are equally likely---the bulk of the density might very well be
closer to one of the edges. Therefore, only relying on the edges can
lead one to either overestimate or underestimate the probabilities at
play. This also means that---following our advice on how to illustrate
the impact of evidence on prior probabilities---a better representation
of the dependence of the posterior on the prior should comprise multiple
possible sampled lines whose density mirrors the density around the
probability of the evidence (Figure \ref{fig:lines}).

\todo{This plot will need fixing}

This, then, is the main claim of this chapter: whenever density
estimates for the probabilities of interest are available (and they
should be available for match evidence and many other items of
scientific evidence if the reliability of a given type of evidence has
been properly studied), those densities should be reported for assessing
the strength of the evidence. This approach avoids hiding actual
aleatory uncertainties under the carpet. It also allows for a balanced
assessment of the evidence, whereas using point estimates or intervals
may exaggerate or underestimate the value of the evidence.

In what follows, we expand on this idea in different directions. Section
\ref{sec:three-probabilism} engages with the philosophical debate about
precise and imprecise probabilism. We argue that both options are
problematic and should be superseded by a higher-order approach to
probability whenever possible. Section \ref{sec:objections} revisits a
recent discussion in the forensic science literature. A prominent view
has it that trial experts, even when they use densities, should present
only first-order probabilities. We disagree and show that reasons of
accuracy maximization sometimes recommend relying on higher-order
probabilities. Section \ref{sec:legal-applications} turns to some legal
applications of higher-order probabilism. We focus on two topics: first,
the role of higher-order probabilities and false positive rates in the
evaluation of DNA evidence; second, how complex bodies of evidence can
be represented by what we call higher-order Bayesian networks.

Before we dive in, one more remark: ost of the time, mathematically, we
do not propose anything radically new---we just put together some of the
items from the standard Bayesian toolkit. The novelty is rather in our
arguing that that these tools are under-appreciated in the legal
scholarship and should be properly used to incorporate second-order
uncertainties in evidence evaluation and incorporation. Perhaps a minor
exception is our explication of the notion of weight, but even here many
related notions are available in information theory, and the novelty
here is not technical, but rather in the argument that they also are
under-appreciated in legal scholarship.

\label{sec:objections}

This section addresses a number of conceptual difficulties that may
arise in using higher-order probabilities, with focus on those brought
up by prominent legal evidence scholars. In discussing these conceptual
issues, we will formulate an accuracy-based argument that higher-order
probabilities are preferable to precise probabilities.

\hypertarget{the-taroni-sjerps-debate}{%
\subsection{The Taroni-Sjerps debate}\label{the-taroni-sjerps-debate}}

Our treatment will be centered around a discussion initiated by Taroni
et al. (2015), who argue extensively that trial experts should avoid
report higher-order densities, and should only report point estimates.
Their point of departure is a reflection on match evidence.

Say an expert reports at trial that the sample from the crime scene
matches the defendant. The significance of this match should be
evaluated in light of the population frequency \(\theta\) of the
matching profile. This frequency, however, cannot be known for sure and
must instead be estimated.

The expert will estimate the true parameter \(\theta\) by means of a
probability distribution \(p(\theta)\) over its possible values. For
example, if the observations are realizations of independent and
identically distributed Bernoulli trails given \(\theta\), the expert's
uncertainty about \(\theta\) can be modeled as
\(\s{beta}(\alpha + s + 1 ,\beta + n - s)\), where \(s\) is the number
of observed successes, \(n\) the number of observations in the database
(1 is added to the first shape parameter to include the match with the
suspect), and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) reflect the expert's priors.

However, they insist, in front of the fact-finders, the expert is
supposed to report their epistemic uncertainty, which is to be
understood according to the subjective interpretation. On this
interpretation, probabilities express an agent's epistemic attitude
towards a proposition, their uncertainty about its truth value. Such
probabilities, Taroni et al. (2015) insist, unlike frequencies, are not
states of nature, but states of mind associated with individuals. For
this reason, they claim, it makes no sense to talk about second-order
uncertainty about subjective probabilities, as there is no underlying
state of the nature to estimate. Further, they insist this also applies
to likelihood ratios:

\begin{quote}
\dots there is no meaningful state of nature equivalent for the likelihood ratio in its entirety, as it is given by a ratio of two conditional probabilities. [p. 12]
\end{quote}

\noindent In line with this perspectives, in the elicitation of
probabilities Taroni et al. (2015) recommend investigating an agent's
betting preferences, and that a proper elicitation of this form will
lead to a single number.\footnote{``Clearly, one can adjust the measure
  of belief of success in the reference gamble in such a way that one
  will be indifferent with respect to the truth of the event about which
  one needs to give one's probability. This understanding is
  fundamental, as it implies that probability is given by a single
  number. It may be hard to define, but that does not mean that
  probability does not exist in an individual's mind. One cannot
  logically have two different numbers because they would reflect
  different measures of belief.'' {[}p.~7{]}} \noindent Moreover, while
they claim that it is fine to use distributions to talk about chance,
they deny this possibility for personal uncertainty, under the threat of
infinite regress:

\begin{quote}
One can, in fact, have probabilities for events, or probabilities for propositions, but not probabilities of probabilities, otherwise one would have an infinite regression. [p. 8]
\end{quote}

\noindent Accordingly, Taroni et al. (2015) insist that given a
frequentist estimation of the probability of the evidence given the
defense hypothesis, \dots

\begin{quote}
\dots personal beliefs [\dots] can be computed as:
\begin{align*}\pr{E} & = \int_{\theta} \pr{E\vert \theta} \pr{\theta}\,\, d\theta \\
& =  \int_\theta  \theta \pr{\theta}\,\, d\theta
\end{align*}
\end{quote}

\noindent In particular, for the DNA match example, they advice that the
personal belief is the expected value of the \(\s{beta}\) distribution,
which reduces to \(\nicefrac{\alpha + s + 1}{\alpha + \beta +n + 1}\).
They claim that it satisfactorily expresses the posterior uncertainty
about \(\theta\), and that it is solely this probability that should be
used in the denominator in the calculation and reporting of the
likelihood ratio.

Nothing so far should be controversial. However, the question arises of
how the expert should report their own uncertainty about \(\theta\),
especially in the light of the usual practice of reporting likelihood
ratios.

To fix the notation, let the prosecution hypothesis \(H_p\) be that the
suspect is the source of the trace, and the defense hypothesis \(H_d\)
that another person, unrelated to the suspect, is the source. For
simplicity, assume that if \(H_p\) holds, the laboratory will surely
report a match \(M\), so that \(\pr{M\vert H_p}=1\). The likelihood
ratio, then, reduces to \(\nicefrac{1}{\pr{M \vert H_d}}\)---but given
that \(\theta\) was estimated using density over its possible values, it
is not obvious how a single value \(\pr{M \vert H_d}\) is to be obtained
and whether its use in the reporting does not hide the uncertainty
involved in the estimation of \(\theta\) under the carpet.

Taroni et al. (2015) claim that the point estimate for the match
evidence given the defense hypothesis should be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}\pr{M \vert H_d} & = \int_{\theta} \pr{M\vert \theta} \pr{\theta}\,\, d\theta \\
& =  \int_\theta  \theta \pr{\theta}\,\, d\theta
\end{align*} In case of a DNA match, they recommend that the expert
report the expected value of the \(\s{beta}\) distribution, which
reduces to \(\nicefrac{\alpha + s + 1}{\alpha + \beta +n + 1}\). They
claim that this number satisfactorily expresses the posterior
uncertainty about \(\theta\). For them, it is this probability alone
that should be used in the denominator in the calculation and reporting
of the likelihood ratio.

Sjerps et al. (2015) disagree. In reporting a single value, the expert
would refrain from providing the fact-finders with relevant information
that can make a difference in the proper evaluation of the evidence.
There is a difference between (a) an expert who is certain \(\theta\) is
\(.1\); (b) an expert whose best estimate of \(\theta\) is \(.1\) based
on thousands of observations; and (c) an expert whose best estimate of
\(\theta\) is again \(.1\) but based on only ten observations.

These three scenarios mirror scenarios we discussed earlier: (a) the
bias of a coin is known for sure; (b) the bias is estimated on the basis
of a large number of tosses; and (c) the bias is estimated using a small
set of observations. As our critique of precise probabilism makes clear,
a simple point estimate (or precise probability) would fail to capture
the differences among the three scenarios. This concern might be
slightly mitigated by the fact that Taroni et al. (2015) admits that the
expert, besides providing a point estimate, should also informally
explain how the estimate was arrived at. They grant that this additional
information can be helpful so long as the recipients are instructed on
``the nature of probability, the importance of an understanding of it
and its proper use in dealing with uncertainty'' {[}p.~16{]}. But why
stop at an informal presentation? It is unclear why the fact-finders
should be deprived of quantifiable information about the aleatory
uncertainty of the parameter of interest and only be given an informal
description of what the expert did, along with some remarks about the
nature of probability. It is wildly optimistic to assume that an
informal description of how the point estimate has been arrived at is
enough to secure a proper assessment of the evidence. We hope to have
convinced the reader already in the introduction that informal treatment
and bare intuitions are not good enough even when it comes to the
evaluation of the impact of a rather simple combination of two items of
evidence if all the fact-finder has to go by is point estimates and and
informal description of how the estimates have been obtained.

Somewhat surprisingly, most of the concerns raised by Taroni et al.
(2015) are philosophical. They argue that if probabilities express an
agent's epistemic attitude towards a proposition probabilities are not
states of nature, but states of mind associated with individuals. They
think this claim has two consequences. First, it makes no sense sense to
talk about second-order uncertainty about subjective probabilities, as
there is no ``underlying state of the nature'' to estimate. Second, if
these subjective probabilities can be elicited by examining an agent's
betting preferences, a proper elicitation will lead to a single
number.\footnote{They write: ``Clearly, one can adjust the measure of
  belief of success in the reference gamble in such a way that one will
  be indifferent with respect to the truth of the event about which one
  needs to give one's probability. This understanding is fundamental, as
  it implies that probability is given by a single number. It may be
  hard to define, but that does not mean that probability does not exist
  in an individual's mind. One cannot logically have two different
  numbers because they would reflect different measures of belief.''
  (Taroni et al., 2015, p. 7)}

In response to the philosophical argument, Dahlman \& Nordgaard (2022)
have also emphasized that the distinction is not so clear-cut. They
argue that, if a probability assessment is a subjective attitude that is
elicited via a betting preference, a probability assessment is itself a
state of nature, ``the formation of a betting preference by a certain
person at a certain time'' {[}p.~15{]}. While we will have something to
say about the philosophical dimension of this debate, let us first
develop a less philosophically involved argument for the position taken
by Sjerps et al. (2015).

\hypertarget{an-accuracy-based-argument}{%
\subsection{An accuracy-based
argument}\label{an-accuracy-based-argument}}

\todo{see M'scomment in boldface}

\textbf{M's comment: This accuracy-based argument is evocative and intriguing, but what does it show really? What is the significance of using PMF based on a point estimate versus a posterior predictive PMF? Does this correspond to something that is done in court? How? The more interesting question is whether using higher-order probabilities reduces errors, say the rate of false convictions or false acquittals. Does it? If so, how?}

With this argument, we hope to break the stalemate in the debate by
proving an argument to which both parties should be receptive. It is an
accuracy-based argument in favor of using higher-order
probabilities---roughly, it says, if you discard relevant information
that you already have contained in the densities resulting from the
estimation and rely on point estimates only, your predictions about the
world will be less accurate in a very precise and quantifiable sense.

First, let us go over a particular example. Suppose we randomly draw a
true population frequency from the uniform distribution. In our
particular case, we obtained 0.632. Then, we randomly draw a sample size
as a natural number between 10 and 20. In our particular case, it is 16.
Next, we simulate an experiment in which we draw that number of
observations from the true distribution. We observe 8 successes and use
this number to calculate the point estimate of the parameter, which is
\texttt{r} round(pointEstimate,3)`.

What is the probability mass function (PMF) for all possible outcomes of
an observation of the same size? Two PMF are initially relevant: first,
the true probability mass based on the true parameter; second, the
probability mass function based on the point estimate which is binomial
around the point estimate. This latter PMF, however, does not take into
account the uncertainty about the point estimate. To take this
uncertainty seriously, continuing our example, we take a sample
distribution of size 16 of possible parameter values from the posterior
\(\s{beta}(1+\s{successes}, 1+\s{sample size} - \s{successes})\)
distribution (we assume uniform prior for the sake of an example). Then,
we use this sample of parameter values to simulate observations, one
simulation for each parameter value in the sample. This simulation
yields the so-called \emph{posterior predictive distribution} (or
posterior predictive PMF), which instead of a point estimate, propagates
the uncertainty about the parameter value into the predictions about the
outcomes of possible observations. Finally, we take simulated
frequencies as our estimates of probabilities. This distribution is more
honest about uncertainty and wider than the one obtained using the point
estimate. The three PMFs are displayed in Figure
\ref{fig:posteriorPrediction}.

\caption{Real probability mass, probability mass calculated using a point estimate, sampling distribution from the posterior, and the posterior predictive distribution based on this sampling distribution.}
\label{fig:posteriorPrediction}
\end{figure}

The PMF based on a point estimate is further off from the real PMF than
the posterior predictive distribution. For instance, if we ask about the
probability of the outcome being at least 9 successes, the true answer
is 0.7984, the point estimate PMF tells us it is 0.4056, while the
posterior predictive distribution gives a somewhat better guess at
0.4277. A similar thing happens when we ask about the probability of the
outcome being at most 9 successes. The true answer is 0.3681, the
point-estimate-based answer is 0.778, while the posterior predictive
distribution yields 0.7051. More generally, we can use an
information-theoretic measure, Kullback-Leibler divergence, to quantify
how far the point-estimate PMF and the posterior predictive PMF are from
the true
PMF.\footnote{A bit of explanation of this divergence measure. Suppose we are dealing with a variable $X$ with $n$ distinct possible discrete states $x_1, \dots, x_n$ and consider two probability mass functions $p$ and $q$ which express uncertainty about the true value of $X$ so that, say, on $p$, $\pr{X=x_i}=p_i$. First, the uncertainty of a given distribution $p$, its \emph{entropy}, is given by the sum of the logarithms of surprise $\nicefrac{1}{p_i}$ for all the possible values,  $H(p) = \sum x_i \log \frac{1}{p_i} = - \sum p_i \log p_i$.  Next, suppose events arise according to $p$, but we predict them
using $q$. The \emph{cross-entropy}  is then  $\mathsf{H}(p, q)  = \sum p_i \log(q_i)$. This value is going to be higher than the entropy of $p$ if $q$ is different from it. Think of it as the uncertainty involved in using $q$ to predict events that arise according to $p$.  Third, \emph{Kullback-Leibler}  divergence is the additional entropy introduced by
using $q$ instead of $p$ itself, that is, the difference between cross-entropy and entropy:
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{DKL}(p, q) & = H(p, q) - H(p)\\
&= - \sum p_i \log q_i   - \left(   - \sum p_i \log p_i \right) \\
& = - \sum p_i\left( \log q_i - \log p_i\right)\\
& =  \sum p_i\left( \log p_i - \log q_i\right)\\
& = \sum p_i \log \left( \frac{p_i}{q_i}\right)
\end{align*} \noindent  As it turns out, KL divergence is also the expected
difference in log probabilities. In particular, if
\(p=q\) we get
\(DKL(p,p) = \sum p_i (\log p_i - \log p_i) = 0\),
which works out as it intuitively should be.}

In our particular case, the former distance is \texttt{r}
kld(testProbs,pointProbs)` and the latter is 0.5681121. The posterior
predictive distribution is information-theoretically closer to the true
distribution.

This was just one example, but the phenomenon generalizes. We repeat the
simulation 1000 times, each time with a new true parameter, a new sample
size, and a new sample. Every time the three PMFs are constructed using
the methods we described and their KL divergence from the true
distribution is calculated. Figure \ref{fig:kldsPlots} displays the
empirical distribution of the results of such a simulation. A positive
value indicates that the distribution based on the point-estimate was
further from the true PMF than the posterior predictive distribution
based on the same observed sample. Notably, the mean difference is
\texttt{r} round(mean(klds),3)`, the median difference is 0.044, and the
distribution is asymmetrical, as there are multiple cases of large
differences favoring posterior predictive distributions over point-based
predictions. All in all, accuracy-wise, point-estimate-based PMFs are
systematically worse than the posterior predictive distribution.

\subsection{Conceptual issues}\label{conceptual-issues}}

\todo{M's comment in boldface}

\textbf{M's comments: this subsection looks muddled to me. It goes around in circles. I cannot follow the argument. What is the key point made in this subection? The key point seems to be this: just like we compare the plausibility/probability of propositions like "defendant was at crime scene" and "defedant was not at crime scenbe", we compare the plausibility/probability of propositions like "random match probability is .0001" and "random match probability of .0002". The second comparison requires higher-order probabilities. Is this the point? But Taroni is saying that we can average over all possible random match probabilities and get a point estimate. What do we say in response to that?}

Accuracy considerations aside, we will now engage with the more
conceptual points. Taroni et al. (2015) argue that since first-order
probabilities capture your uncertainty about a proposition of interest,
second-order probabilities are supposed to capture your uncertainty
about how uncertain you are, and that ``estimating'' your first-order
uncertainties is unnecessary. They think that you can simply figure out
your fair odds in a suitable bet on the proposition in question, and the
fair odds track your unique, first-order uncertainty without any
uncertainty about it. But this point can be questioned. For one thing,
the betting interpretation of probability is not
uncontroversial.\footnote{See textbooks in formal epistemology (D.
  Bradley, 2015; Titelbaum, 2020).} Even assuming the betting
interpretation, there seems to be nothing wrong in saying that sometimes
we are\todo{add ref to Williamson} uncertain about what we think the
fair bets are.\footnote{On a related note, the introspective axioms in
  epistemic logic---that is, if an agent knows (or doesn't know) \(p\),
  they also know that they (don't) know \(p\)---are by no means
  uncontroversial. See, for example, Williamson 2000 (chapter 5)'s
  argument against the KK principle of positive introspection.} But
admittedly, this answer while undermines the betting argument for the
sufficiency of point estimates, does not cast much light on what the
appropriate relatively uncontroversial interpretation of higher-order
uncertainty should be.
\todo{M's: I don't understand the argument here. What is a "relatively uncontroversial interpretation"?}

Think again about an expert who gathers information about the allelic
frequency \(f\) of DNA matches in an available database, and starts with
a defensible \s{beta} prior with parameters \(\alpha, \beta\). Say the
expert observes \(s\) matches in a database of size \(n\). So the
population relative frequency the experts is estimating should follow
the \(\s{beta}(\alpha + s + 1 ,\beta + n - s)\) distribution. So far,
nothing controversial happens---the expert is estimating the relevant
population frequency.

But subjective uncertainty that is to be reported by the expert, Taroni
et al. (2015) complain, is not about the frequency, but about their
attitude towards a proposition (supposedly expressing a ``state of
nature'')---and, they insist, it makes no sense for an agent to attach
uncertainty to their own uncertainty about a proposition.

Assuming the conditions are pristine (the expert has no modeling
uncertainty, rules out laboratory errors, and so on), the beta
distribution can be used to pretty directly inform the expert's
subjective uncertainty. But uncertainty about what? The (estimated)
population frequency, for instance, can underlie a probability
assignment to the proposition
\emph{a match is observed  if another person, unrelated to the suspect, is the source of the trace}.
Admittedly, if only this proposition is being considered, it is yet not
clear what second-order uncertainties would be uncertainties about. But
the expert also considers a continuum of propositions, each of the form
\emph{the true population frequency is $\theta$} for each
\(\theta\in [0,1]\). A density over \(\theta\) models the comparative
plausibility that the expert assigns to such propositions in light of
the
evidence.\footnote{Moreover, and normalization allows them to calculate their subjective probabilities for $\theta$ belonging to various sub-intervals of $[0,1]$.}
So if one were worried that there were no propositions that the expert
could be ``second-order'' uncertain about, there actually are plenty.
\todo{M: who was worried that there were no second-order propositions? What argument in the literature is this a response to? I cannot follow.}
In particular, if \(\theta\) is a population frequency, gauging which
density captures the extent to which the evidence justifies various
estimates of that frequency is the same as gauging the comparative
plausibility of the corresponding propositions about possible population
frequencies.\footnote{Perhaps, this should no longer be called
  ``estimation'', but the the connection with estimation is strong
  enough to justify this terminology. In the end, this is a verbal
  discussion that we will not get into.}

More generally, in many contexts, evidence justifies first-order
probability assignments (population frequency estimates) to various
degrees. Suppose there is no evidence about the bias of a coin. Then,
each first-order uncertainty about it would be equally (un)-justified.
(If you like to think in terms of bets, the evidence would give no
reason to prefer any particular odds as fair.) If, instead, we know the
coin is fair, the evidence clearly selects one preferred value, .5.
(Again, if you like the betting metaphor, 1:1 would be the unique
recommended betting odds.) But often the evidence is stronger than the
former case and weaker than the latter case. Consider, for example,
propositions about population frequencies in light of the results of
observations. In such circumstances, the evidence justifies different
values of first-order uncertainty to various degrees, and densities
simply capture the extent to which different first-order uncertainties
are supported by the evidence.

We conclude this section by examining two additional points raised by
Taroni et al. (2015). The first---which we already alluded to
earlier---is that first-order probabilities are not ``states of nature''
and so cannot be estimated. It is unclear why the authors insist that
only states of nature can be estimated. Mathematicians use approximate
methods to estimate answers to fairly abstract questions, not obviously
related to ``states of nature'', whatever these are. So, estimation
should make sense whenever there are some objective answers that we can
approximate to a greater or lesser extent. If there is some objectivity
to what the ideal evidence would support, or to the extent to which the
actual evidence supports various competing hypotheses, we can be more or
less wrong about such things, and so it is not implausible to say that
there is a clear sense in which we can estimate them.\footnote{Taroni et
  al. (2015) make the same point for likelihood ratios. They argue that
  there is no ``meaningful state of nature equivalent for the likelihood
  ratio in its entirety, as it is given by a ratio of two conditional
  probabilities?'' But if it is meaningful to estimate two conditional
  probabilities (that is, frequencies in the population), or to compare
  the relative plausibility of various propositions about them in terms
  of density, it is equally meaningful to estimate any function of the
  numbers involved. Otherwise it would also be meaningless to try to
  estimate the body mass index (BMI) of an average 21 years old male
  student in the USA just because BMI is a ratio of other quantities.
  There are reasons not to care about BMI, but it not being a state of
  nature because it is a function of other values is not one of them.}

\todo{added back the claim about not worrying about BMI, as some readers might be sensitive to anyone bringing BMI up}

Second, Taroni et al. (2015) argue that once we allow second-order
probability, we run into the threat of infinite regress. But do we?
Surely, they would agree that one can be uncertain about a statistical
model. But this can be the case even if this model spits out a point
estimate rather than a density. If you think the possibility of putting
uncertainty on top of propositions about possible values of a
first-order parameter leaves us in an epistemically hopeless situation,
you might have hard time explaining why your point estimation is in a
better situation. After all, if asking further questions about
probabilities up the hierarchy is always justified, we can keep asking
about the probability of a point-estimate-spitting model, the
probability of that probability, and so on.

Perhaps the problem at issue is just one of complexity. Admittedly,
second-order estimation is more complex than relying on point estimates.
But we hope to have convinced the reader this complexity is worth the
effort. What about more complex models going third-order? If a workable
approach can accomplish that---and the additional complexity pays
off---we are all for going third-order. The fact that more complex
models can always be built hardly lead us into a vicious infinite
regress. Rather, it is an indication that our models of uncertainty
can---in principle---always be improved.

\inbook{Add carpet evidence in the Wayne Williams case}

Our discussion so far has been mostly theoretical. We made a case that
higher-order probabilism outperforms precise probabilism on both
descriptive and normative grounds. We also staved off a number of
conceptual difficulties with going higher-order. It is time to extend
our discussion from the introduction to a further illustration of how
higher-order probabilism can be of service in evaluating evidence at
trial. We present here two examples.

\hypertarget{false-positives-in-dna-identification}{%
\subsection{False Positives in DNA
Identification}\label{false-positives-in-dna-identification}}

One important topic is that of errors in the process of DNA match
evidence evaluation. As already known, the probability of a false
positive caused by contamination, laboratory or evidence collection or
storage error has serious impact on the value of DNA match evidence. As
Thompson, Taroni, \& Aitken (2003) have shown, the probability of false
positives, even when seemingly low, has a non-negligible impact:

\begin{quote}
If, as commentators have suggested, the rate of false positives is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000, or even less, then one might argue that the jury can safely rule out
the prospect that the reported match in their case is due to error and can proceed to consider the probability of a coincidental match \dots this argument is fallacious and profoundly misleading \dots  the probability that a reported match occurred due to error in a particular case can be much higher, or lower, than the false positive probability.
\end{quote}

\noindent We are particularly interested in the passing remark that the
rate of false positives is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1000. This
difference is not negligible. The simplest option would be to use the
upper bound of the {[}0.001, 0.01{]} interval. This choice would be the
most favorable toward the defendant. But, as already noted in the
introduction, doing so would lead to an overly conservative evaluation
of the evidence. It is much preferable to have a sensible distribution
to work with.

To fix ideas, the posterior probability of the source hypothesis (\(S\))
conditional on the match evidence (\(E\)) is, with some idealization, as
follows:

\begin{align*}
\pr{S \vert E} &   =  \frac{\pr{E\vert S} \pr{S} } {\pr{E}}\\
& = \frac{\overbrace{\pr{E\vert S}}^1 \pr{S}}{\underbrace{\pr{E\vert S}}_1 \pr{S} + \underbrace{\pr{E \vert RM}}_1 \pr{RM} + \underbrace{\pr{E \vert FP}}_1 \pr{FP}} \\ & = \frac{\pr{S}}{\pr{S} + \pr{RM} + \pr{FP}}
\end{align*}

\noindent For simplicity, the false negative rate is assumed to be zero,
or in other words, \(\pr{E\vert S} =1\). The other assumption is that
the evidence could come about if: (1) the source hypothesis is true; (2)
a random match (\(RM\)) occurred; or (3) a false positive match occurred
(\(FP\)).

Suppose the random match probability for the DNA match evidence is
rather low, say \(10^{-9}\), and there is no uncertainty associated with
this number. Consider now two ways of assessing the DNA match. First,
disregarding the possibility of a false positive---setting \(FP\) to
\(0\)---makes the match evidence appear extremely strong. In this case,
the minimal prior sufficient for the posterior to be above .99 is only
\texttt{RR\ min(prior{[}pristinePosterior\ \textgreater{}=\ .99{]})},
where the relation between the prior probabilities and the posterior
probabilities of the source hypothesis is given by the dashed orange
line in Figure \ref{fig:fplinesPlot}. What happens after taking into
account the possibility of a false positive match? This depends on how
this possibility of error is quantified. Assume the false positive rate
corresponds to the upper bound of the {[}0.001, 0.01{]} interval. This
assumption completely changes the assessment of the match evidence. Now
the posterior of \(.99\) is reached only if the prior is above .99. The
match evidence appears to be extremely weak. So which is it? As already
seen in the introduction, the point estimate exaggerates the value of
the match evidence, while using the upper bound of the false positive
rate has the opposite effect. What happens within the {[}0.001, 0.01{]}
interval cannot be ignored.

To take into consideration the values within the edges, it would be best
to have a good density estimate of the false positive errors frequency,
as we should, if the issue had been properly studied. But we do not. For
now, we will illustrate the consequences of taking two different
approaches. On one approach, any value between the edges is considered
equally likely (and we add a little leeway on top). On another approach,
not all values are equally likely---for example, suppose you think it is
50\% likely that the false positive rate is below .0033. In addition,
suppose the distribution, while being centered closer to zero, is
long-tailed (we used a truncated normal distribution here). These two
distributions are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:fppdistros}. On both
approaches, we assume that the false positive rate is between 0.001 and
0.01 with 99\% certainty. The uniform distribution---which regards all
false positive rates in the interval as equally likely---leads to a
rather conservative evaluation of the match evidence, much more so than
the truncated normal distribution. This is apparent from Figure
\ref{fig:fppMinima} and \ref{fig:fplinesPlot}, which show the prior
probabilities of the source hypothesis needed to secure a posterior
probability above .99. Working with a distribution---more so if it is
not a uniform distribution---affords a more balanced assessment of the
evidence than simply relying on the edges of an interval.

The lingering question, however, is how these distributions can be
obtained. Admittedly, studies on false positives are limited and only
give an incomplete picture. More studies are needed. This does not mean,
however, that until then using point estimates and interval edges is
preferable. After deciding on the functional form of a
distribution---such as truncated normal or beta---only a few numbers
need to be elicited from experts for constructing a density.\footnote{For
  instance, assuming the distribution is a truncated normal, it is
  enough for the expert to assert that both the 99\% interval is as the
  one we used, and that they believe with more than 50\% confidence the
  false positive rates to be below \(.033\) for the curve to be
  determined.} Having to rely on such elicitation is not without
problems, but it is better than asking experts for single point
estimates and relying on these (O'Hagan et al., 2006).

\section{Higher-order Bayesian
Networks}\label{higher-order-bayesian-networks}}

The higher-order framework we are advocating is not only applicable to
the evaluation of individual pieces of evidence. Complex bodies of
evidence---for example, those represented by Bayesian networks---can
also be assessed using higher-order probabilities. One fairly
straightforward way to go about this is to stochastically generate
Bayesian networks using our uncertainty about the parameter values,
update with the evidence, and propagate uncertainty to approximate the
marginal posterior for nodes of interest.

As an illustration, let us start with a simplified Bayesian network
developed by Fenton \& Neil (2018). The network is reproduced in Figure
\ref{fig:scBNplot} and represents the key items of evidence in the
infamous British case R. v. Clark (EWCA Crim 54, 2000).\footnote{Sally
  Clark's first son died in 1996 soon after birth, and her second son
  died in similar circumstances a few years later in 1998. At trial, the
  pediatrician Roy Meadow testified that the probability that a child
  from such a family would die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)
  was 1 in 8,543. Meadow calculated that therefore the probability of
  both children dying of SIDS was approximately 1 in 73 million. Sally
  Clark was convicted of murdering her infant sons. The conviction was
  reversed on appeal. The case of appeal was based on new evidence:
  signs of a potentially lethal disease were found in one of the bodies.}

In a Bayesian network the arrows depict direct relationships of
influence between variables, and nodes---conditional on their
parents---are taken to be independent of their non-descendants.
\textsf{Amurder} and \textsf{Bmurder} are binary nodes corresponding to
whether Sally Clark's sons, call them A and B, were murdered. These
nodes influence whether signs of disease (\textsf{Adisease} and
\textsf{Bdisease}) and bruising (\textsf{Abruising} and
\textsf{Bbruising}) were present. Also, since A's death preceded in time
B's death, whether A was murdered casts some light on the probability
that B was also murdered.

The choice of the probabilities in the network is quite specific, and it
is not clear where such precise values come from. The standard response
invokes \emph{sensitivity analysis}: a range of plausible values is
tested. As already discussed, this approach ignores the shape of the
underlying distributions. Sensitivity analysis does not make any
difference between probability measures (or point estimates) in terms of
their plausibility, but some will be more plausible than others.
Moreover, if the sensitivity analysis is guided by extreme values, these
might play an undeservedly strong role. These concerns can be addressed,
at least in part, by recourse to higher-order probabilities. In a
precise Bayesian network, each node is associated with a probability
table determined by a finite list of numbers (precise probabilities).
But suppose that, instead of precise numbers, we have densities over
parameter values for the numbers in the probability tables.\footnote{The
  densities of interests can then be approximated by (1) sampling
  parameter values from the specified distributions, (2) plugging them
  into the construction of the BN, and (3) evaluating the probability of
  interest in that precise BN. The list of the probabilities thus
  obtained will approximate the density of interest. In what follows we
  will work with sample sizes of 10k.}\\
An example of a higher-order Bayesian network for the Sally Clark case
is given in Figure \ref{fig:SCwithHOP}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Example of a higher-order Bayesian network for the Sally Clark Case.}
\label{fig:SCwithHOP}
\end{figure}

With the help of the higher-order Bayesian network, we can investigate
the impact of different items of evidence on Sally Clark's probability
of guilt (Figure \ref{fig:SCwithHOP2}). The starting point is the prior
density for the \s{Guilt} node (first graph). Next, the network is
updated with evidence showing signs of bruising on both children (second
graph). Next, the assumption that both children lack signs of
potentially lethal disease is added (third graph). Finally, we consider
the state of the evidence at the time of the appellate case: signs of
bruising existed on both children, but signs of lethal disease were
discovered only on the first child. Interestingly, in the strongest
scenario against Sally Clark (third graph), the median of the posterior
distribution is above .95, but the uncertainty around that median is
still too wide to warrant a conviction.\footnote{The lower limit of the
  89\% Highest Posterior Density Intervals (HPDI) is at .83.} This
underscores the fact that relying on point estimates can lead to
overconfidence. Paying attention to the higher-order uncertainty about
the first-order probability can make a difference to trial decisions.

\end{figure}

One question that arises is how this approach relates to the standard
method of using likelihood ratios to report the value of the evidence.
On this approach, the conditional probabilities that are used in the
likelihood ratio calculations are estimated and come in a package with
an uncertainty about them. Accordingly, these uncertainties propagate:
to estimate the likelihood ratio while keeping track of the uncertainty
involved, we can sample probabilities from the selected distributions
appropriate for the conditional probabilities needed for the
calculations, then divide the corresponding samples, obtaining a sample
of likelihood ratios, thus approximating the density capturing the
recommended uncertainty about the likelihood ratio. Uncertainty about
likelihood ratio is just propagated uncertainty about the involved
conditional probabilities. For instance, we can use this tool to gauge
our uncertainty about the likelihood ratios corresponding to the signs
of bruising in son A and the presence of the symptoms of a potentially
lethal disease in son A (Figure \ref{fig:SClrs}).

\hypertarget{relationship-with-bayesian-hierarchical-models}{%
\subsection{Relationship with Bayesian hierarchical
models}\label{relationship-with-bayesian-hierarchical-models}}

Our approach does involve multiple parameters, uncertainty about them,
and some dependency structure between random variables. So it is only
natural to ask whether what we propose is not just an old wolf in a new
sheep's clothing, as one might think that what looks like a DAG and
quacks like a DAG is always a hierarchical model. In this section we
briefly clarify what the answer to this question is.

First, we need some clarity on what a Bayesian hierarchical model is. In
the widest sense of the word, these are mathematical descriptions
involving multiple parameters such that credible values for some of them
meaningfully depend on the values of other parameters, and that
dependencies can be re-factored into a chain of dependencies. For
instance, think about a joint parameter space for two parameters
\(\theta\) and \(\omega\), where
\(p(\theta, \omega \vert D) \propto p(D \vert \theta, \omega)p(\theta, \omega)\).
If, further, some independence-motivated re-factoring of the right-hand
side---for instance as
\(p(D\vert \theta)p(\theta \omega)) p (\omega)\)---is possible, we are
dealing with a hierarchical model in the wide sense of the word.

Such models usually come useful when we are dealing with clustered data,
such as a cohort study with repeated measures, or some natural groupings
at different levels of analysis. Then, lower-level parameters are
treated as i.i.d. and share the same parameter distribution
characterized by some hyper-parameters in turn characterized by a prior
distribution. As a simple example consider a scenario in which we are
dealing with multiple coins created by one mint---each coin has its own
bias \(\theta_i\), but also there is some commonality as to what these
biases are in this mint, represented by a higher-level parameter
\(\theta\). Continuing the example, assume
\(\theta_i \sim \mathsf{Beta}(a, b)\) and
\(y_{i\vert s} \sim \mathsf{Bern}(\theta_s)\), where the former
distribution can be re-parametrized as
\(\mathsf{Beta}(\omega(k-2)+1, (1-\omega)(k-2)+1)\). Let's keep \(k\)
fixed, \(\omega\) is our expected value of the \(\theta_i\) parameters,
with some dispersion around it determined by \(k\). Now, if we also are
uncertain about \(\omega\) and express our uncertainty about it in terms
a density \(p(\omega)\), we got ourselves a hierarchical model with
joint prior distribution over parameters
\(\prod p(\theta_i \vert \omega) p(\omega)\).

As another example, one can develop a multilevel regression model of the
distributions of the radom levels in various counties, where both the
intercept and the slope vary with counties by taking
\(y_i\sim \mathsf{Norm}(\alpha_{\mbox{j[i]}}\, + \beta_{\mbox{j[i]}} x_i, \sigma^2_y )\),
where \(j\) is a county index,
\(\alpha_j \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu_\alpha,\sigma_\alpha^2 )\), and
\(\beta_j \sim \mathsf{No}rm(\mu_\beta,\sigma_\beta^2 )\). Then, running
the regression one estimates both the county-level coefficients, and the
higher-level parameters.

Our approach is similar to the standard hierarchical models in the most
general sense: there is a meaningful independence structure and
distributions over parameter values that we are working with. However,
our approach is unlike such models in a few respects. For one, we are
not dealing with clustered data, and the random variables are mostly
propositions and their truth values. Given a hypothesis \(H\) and an
item of evidence \(E\) for it, there seems to be no interesting
conceptualization on which the underlying data would be clustered. After
all, for instance, it is not that stains at a crime scene are a subgroup
of crimes being committed---this does not even make sense. Yes, there is
dependency between these phenomena, but describing it as clustering
would be at least misleading. Second, the dependencies proceed through
the values of the random variables which are \textbf{not} parameters,
but rather truth-values, and require also conditional uncertainties
regarding the dependencies between these truth-values.

Again, continuing the hypothesis-evidence example, we have
\(H \sim \mathsf{Bern}(p_h)\), \(p_h \sim \mathsf{Beta}(a_h, b_h)\), and
\(E\sim \mathsf{Bern}(p_e)\). But then we also have the beta
distributions for the probability of the evidence conditional on the
actual values of the random variables---the truth-values---thus
\(p_e \vert H = 1 \sim beta(a_{+}, b_{+} )\) and
\(p_e \vert H = 0 \sim \mathsf{Beta}(a_{-}, b_{-})\). But the
re-factoring in terms of the actual values of the random variables
(which just happen to resemble probabilities because they are truth
values) makes it quite specific, at the same time allowing for the
computational use of Bayesian networks. Finally, the reasoning we
describe is not a regression the way it is normally performed: the
learning task is delegated to the bottom level of whatever happens to
the Bayesian networks once updated with evidence.
