# The Book

## Brief Description 

\footnotesize In one or two paragraphs, describe the work, including its rationale, approach, and pedagogy. (This book is... It does... Its distinguishing features are...)

\normalsize


Can the evidence presented at trial be examined, weighed and assessed using probability theory? Can legal decision-making and standards of proof such as 'preponderance of the evidence' or 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' be defined using the language of probability and expected utility? Does the deployment of probability theory in assessing evidence and making decisions improve the accuracy and fairness of legal decision-making? Over the last fifty years, these questions have been extensively debated in the literature in philosophy, law, forensic science and artificial intelligence. Legal probabilism is a research program whose supporters believe that the answer to these questions is, by and large, affirmative. Others, however, hold a less optimistic view.  'Boosting Legal Probabilism' examines the most important objections to this research program and articulates a version of legal probabilism that is able to address many, if not all, of these objections. 

We first articulate the simple version of legal probabilism. This version has much to be reccomeded for, but also falls prey to several difficulties, including the problem of conjunction, puzzles of naked statistical evidence, the problem of priors. Some legal probabilists have attempted to dismiss these difficulties or downplay their significance. We confront them at face value and show they cannot be addressed within the confines of simple legal probabilism. We then develop a more sophisticated version of the theory, what we call legal probabilism 1.02, which deploys Bayesian networks and takes advantage of seminal ideas in the literature in forensic science and artificial intelligence. 'Boosting Legal Probabilism' articulates the first comprehensive philosophical analysis of whether---and if so, to what extent---legal probabilism 1.02 can overcome the limitations of simple legal probabilism. We show that the more sophisticated version significantly improves on the simple version and rivals in explanatory power two competing accounts of judicial fact-finding: argumentation theory and relative plausibility. To add precision to the claims made in the book, the analytical argument is supplemented with an \textbf{\textsf{R}} code implementation.  

'Boosting Legal Probabilism' is aimed at philosophers with an interest in legal epistemology and epistemology more generally. Many of the difficulties of legal probabilism resemble difficulties faced by Bayesianism in epistemology. The book will also draw attention outside philosophy from legal scholars who have championed applications of probability theory to evidence law as well as scholars who have resisted this trend. Another target audience includes computer scientists and psychologists interested in studying evidential reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty. Besides contributing to the literature about legal probabilism, the book aims to introduce unfamiliar readers to the rich interdisciplinary debate on the topic, often scattered throughout journals and books in philosophy, law, computer science, forensic science and psychology. So the book is aimed at scholars, advanced undergraduates and curios readers more generally. Some chapters present original research and require technical background in probability theory. Others are introductory, suitable for an advanced undergraduate course.

## Outline 

\noindent
\textbf{Part I}

\noindent
The first part of the book outlines simple legal probabilism (Chapter 1) 
and its foes (Chapter 2). The simple version comprises 
a familiar repertoire: Bayes' theorem, 
likelihood ratios, probability thresholds, expected utility 
maximization. This repertoire has proven useful in several ways, 
especially in the assessment of explicitly quantitative evidence 
such as DNA matches and other expert evidence. At the same time, 
simple legal probabilism is liable to a host of conceptual difficulties: 
the conjunction problem, the problem of priors, paradoxes of naked statistical evidence. 
These difficulties are well-known. Others are less familiar: 
the problem of complexity, soft variables, the difficulty with corroboration. 

Part I is meant to instill interest in the topic among unfamiliar readers and refresh seasoned readers 
about the main points of contention. Part I provides the essential background for a 
deeper examination of legal probabilism and the development of its 
more sophisticated version. The remaining two parts of the book covers two separate 
topics: evidence assessment (Part II)
and decision-making (Part III). This distinction reflects the fact that legal probabilism is both a theory 
of evidence assessment (or evidence evaluation, evidence weighing) 
as well as a theory of decision-making at trial. These two topics are obviously intertwined in important ways, 
but are best kept separate for analytical clarity. 

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent
\textbf{Part II}

\noindent
The second part of the book discusses in great detail three formal 
tools used for the assessment of evidence from a probabilistic 
perspective: Bayes' theorem, likelihood ratios and Bayesian networks. 
This part discusses how these formal tools can 
help to assess, weigh and evaluate evidence at trial as well as what 
their limitations are. The objective of this part of the book is to articulate a more sophisticated version 
of legal probabilism for evidence assessment which overcomes the difficulties of the simpler version. 

Chapter 3 begins with Bayes' theorem and illustrates how 
the theorem can be put to use in weighing pieces of evidence at trial. Bayes' theorem is useful in many ways, for example, to avoid reasoning 
fallacies such as the prosecutor's fallacy and the base rate fallacy. At the same time, its applications 
are also limited. As discussed in Chapter 4, court cases often 
require fact-finders to weigh several pieces of evidence, sometimes conficting 
and susceptible to different interpretations. The hypotheses 
that the fact-finders are asked to evaluate in light of the evidence  are structured stories 
or explanations constituted by several sub-propositions. This level of complexity 
can hardly be modeled by a simple application of Bayes' theorem. A more sophisticated 
machinery for evidence assessment is nedded. 

Before discussing this more sophisticated machinery, 
the book describes a formal tool that is, in some important way, 
an alternative to Bayes' theorem and 
that many legal probabilists 
have found useful: likelihood ratios. Bayes' theorem requires 
one to assess the prior probabilities of the hypothesis of interest. The problem is that 
assessing  prior probabilities is notoriously difficult. Likelihood ratios offer a way to evaluate 
the evidence presented at trial without the need of assessing prior probabilities. 
Chapter 5 illustrates the many applications of likelihood ratios focusing on 
the debate about cold-hit DNA matches as an illustration. The chapter also examines the weaknesses of 
the likelihood ratio approach, in particular, the chapter details how the choice of the competing hypotheses to be compared in the likelihood ratio is often a source of confusion, manipulation and subjective judgment. A further 
problem is that, like Bayes' theorem, likelihood ratios are still unable to model complex bodies of evidence.



Chapters 3, 4 and 5 -- combined -- show that we need to move past simple legal 
probabilism. The journey toward legal probabilism 1.02 is accomplished in Chapters 6 through 10. We focus 
on two aspects of the evaluation of trial evidence which simple legal probabilism is unable to model: first, judges and jurors often think holistically about the evidence, say in terms of coherent stories or explanations, without assessing the evidence by discrete applications of Bayes' theorem or likelihood ratios; second, different pieces of evidence interact in complex relationships, such as undercutting, rebutting, converging, corroborating evidence. 
We show that Bayesian networks constitute the formal machinery for developing 
a more sophisticated legal probabilism that is able to formally capture these phenomena. 

Chapter 6 offers a crash course on Bayesian networks with a focus on the assessment of legal evidence. A Bayesian network comprises a directed acyclic graph (called a DAG) that represents relations of dependence  between variables, along with conditional probability tables corresponding to these relations. Simple graphical patterns called `idioms' often appear while modeling the relationships between evidence and hypotheses. In the last decade, the literature in artificial intelligence and forensic science has made significant progress in modeling holistic notions such as the coherence of a story and argument-based notions such as conflicts between pieces of evidence.  Chapter 6 surveys this literature focusing on the work of Charlotte Vlek and Norman Fenton.  Vlek, together with Bart Verheij and Henry Prakken, proposed to model the coherence of a story by adding a node in the Bayesian network, call it a 'story node'. The story node has other nodes as its children. These correspond to the events that make up the story. In turn, these events 
are linked to their supporting evidence.  An example of a Bayesian network with a story node 
(or scenario node to use Vlek's terminology) is depicted below:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{vlek-scenario-node.pdf}
 \end{center}
 
Since the story node unifies the different parts of a story, changes in the probabilities of these parts can be used to model 
the notion of coherence. The stronger the (positive) probabilistic dependency between the different parts,  the more coherent the story. There may also be competing stories about what happened, say, one story was put forward by the prosecution and another by the defense. A  Bayesian network can be built that comprises two competing stories and specifies that they are incompatible and cannot be true concurrently. Another approach to model competing stories was developed by Norman Fenton and his research group. Separate stories are represented by separate Bayesian networks, and Bayesian model comparison is then used for assessing the relative strenght of the competing stories.

Chapter 7 and 8 articulate different lines of criticism of Vlek's and Fenton's formalizations. The criticisms are followed by our positive proposal that still relies, like Vlek's and Fenton's, on Bayesian networks.  Chapter 7 focuses on weakenessses of the story node approach as an account of coherence. We show that adding a story node by fiat -- without any good reason for supposing that the different parts of the story are connected other than being part of one story -- introduces unnecessary probabilistic dependencies between the elements of a story. Since these dependencies may or may not exist, they should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and modeled accordingly. In addition, the story node approach is overly simplistic as an account of coherence and fails to engage with the rich philosophical literature on the topic. After the critical part, Chapter 7 articulates a more adequate probabilistic account of the coherence of a story.  Instead of adding a story node, we show that it is more appropriate to assess the dependency between the different parts of a story on a case-by-case basis and build the Bayesian network accordingly. [THIS FEELS A BIT THIN. ANYTHING ELSE HERE TO DESCRIBE THE POSITIVE ACCOUNT OF COHERENCE? ANYTHING TO ADD?]

Chapter 8 and 9 focus on complex relantionships between pieces of evidence, such as conflicting 
evidence and corroborating evidence. A criticism we level against Vlek's story node approch and Fenton's model comparison approach is that they both fail to capture crucial aspects of how pieces of evidence and competing stories conflict with one another at trial. It is too simplistic to posit that the complex adversarial dialectic that takes place in a trial could be modeled by averaging different Bayesian networks (Fenton) or postulating relationships of incompatibility between different story nodes (Vlek). We need an account of more fine-grained notions, such as undercutting and rebutting evidence, and more generally we need an accounf of how cross-examimation operates at trial. What cross-examination often accomplishes is not so much the creation of an alternative story, but rather the reinterpretation of an existign story by supplying additional information As chapter 8 illustrates, this process of reintepretation can be represented formally as the refinement of an existing Bayesian network. We show that, by drawing additional arrows between evidence nodes and hypothesis nodes, conflicts between pieces of evidence such as undercutting and rebutting can be modeled adequately.


The reverse of the phenomenon of conflicting evidence is that of converging evidence, in particular, the fact that one piece of evidence corroborates another. Corroboration has been the focus of extensive scholarly debate often outside the literature in legal probabilism. Chapter 9 surveys the probabilistic literature on corroboration and the main difficulties that have been levelled against the proposed accounts. The chapter then formalizes a notion of corroboration based on Bayesian networks that overcomes most of the difficulties of the exisisting accounts. [ANYTHING ELSE HERE TO DESCRIBE THE POSITIVE ACCOUNT OF CORROBORATION?]

Chapter 10 summarizes our proposal for legal probabilism 1.02, limited to the realm of evidence asessment at trial, draws some general morals and compares our proposal to competing accounts. In preceeding chapters, we show that legal probabilism 1.02 -- roughly, simple legal probabilism supplemented by Bayesian networks -- can represent complex relationships between pieces of evidence such as undercutting and corroboration  (Chapters 8 and 9), as well as holistic notions such as coherence (Chapter 7). The key idea is that the coherence of a story as well as conflicts between pieces of evidence can be modeled formally in terms of corresponding properties of, operations on, and relations between Bayesian networks. Our formal analysis was guided 
by the followign working hypothesis: An accusation of liability must be substantiated by providing a well-specified account -- story, narrative -- of the alleged illegal act committed by the defendant.  This account consists of several moving parts, each supported by different items of evidence. The defense may respond by attacking the supporting evidence, the internal consistency of the account, or by offerring an alternative account. Judges and jurors are tasked with assessing how well the claim that the defendant is civilly or criminally liable is supported by the evidence and how well it stands up against criticism. It is this complex dynamics that we attemped to formalize in the preceeding chapters. 

Chapter 10 compares our proposed version of legal probabilism 1.02 with two competing accounts of judicial fact-finding: argumentation theory and relative plausibility. We suggest that our theory outperforms these comepting accounts in some respect, although we do not claim that it outperforme them on all counts. First, argumentation theory does not offer a clear account of degrees of evidential strenght. Evidence may supports a hypothesis more or less strongly, or two pieces of evodence may conflcts with one another more less strongly. Not only does legal probabilism 1.02 offer an account of evidenetila support, coinflict and convergence, but the account is nuanced enough to capture degrees of support, conflict and converegence. This is marked improvement. Second, relative plausibility is often critized because the defense need not always present a full-fledged alternative story or alternative explaination of the evidence. The critisism is that it should be enough for the defense to challenge the story or explanation proposed by the party, say the prosecution in a criminal case. We do not take a stance on this controversy, but we note that legal probabilism 1.02 is flexible enough to model competing stories or explanations (in agreement with relative plausibility) and alternatively model conflicts between pieces of evidence without the need to construct a full-fledged alternative story or explanation (as critics of relative plausibility prefer). There remains, however, a fundamental difficulty with legal probabilism 1.02,  its cognitive plausibility. It is not clear that the process of evidence assessment naturally conforms to the probabilistic machinery. In fact, it most likely does not. This difficulty does not undermine legal probabilism 1.02 as a theory of evidence assessment, but it certainly quesions its emprical adequacy as a theory of evidence assessment at trial. In this respect, relative plausibility -- and perhpas 
argumentation theory -- fares much better. 

MAYBE ADD OUR ACCOUNT CAN CAPTURE THINGS LIKE COMPLETENESS OF EVIDEMCE, SPECIFICITY OF A NARRATIVE, WHETHER A PIECE OF EVIDENCE IS INDEPENDENTLY SECURED, CROSSWORD PUZZLE ANALOGY AND SUSAN HAACK.

\textbf{Part III}

The final part of the book examines trial-decision making, specifically, to what extent standards of proof such as 'preponderance of the evidence' and 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' can be understood through the lenses of probability theory.

# Sample Chapters

Select one or two chapters of the manuscript that are an integral part of the book. They should be those you consider the best-written ones, and do not have to be in sequence. For example, you might submit chapters 3, 7, and 14 of a 20-chapter book, so long as these chapters represent the content and reflect your writing style and pedagogy in the best possible light. It is also advisable to submit any chapter that is particularly innovative or unique. Sample chapters should contain rough sketches, charts, hand-written musical examples or xerox reproductions, and description of photographs to be included. The material need not be in final form, although it should be carefully prepared and represent your best work. In your preparation, emphasis should be on readability. Please do not bind your manuscript, as we will have to unbind it in order to make photocopies for reviewers. Also be sure all pages are numbered either consecutively or double-numbered by chapter.
