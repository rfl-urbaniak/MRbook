# The Book

## Brief Description 

\footnotesize In one or two paragraphs, describe the work, including its rationale, approach, and pedagogy. (This book is... It does... Its distinguishing features are...)

\normalsize


This book contributes to the development of legal probabilism  by formulating its variant that  accomodates important insights provided by its critics. A crucial point of criticism is that the fact-finding process  should  be conceptualized as a competition of narrations. We develop methods that allow the probabilist to take this perspective, and explain how such methods allow the legal probabilist to address various other objections present in the literature. The key idea is that once  narrations are represented as bayesian networks, various criteria on,  features of  and operations on narrations can be explicated in terms of corresponding properties of and operations on bayesian networks. The conceptual developments are accompanied by  technical accounts,  and \textbf{\textsf{R}} code  capturing to the technical features developed is made available to the reader.  

A secondary goal is to present a unified introduction to multiple positive contributions  of legal probilism to the status of legal evidence evaluation, as many such results are scattered over many professional journals from different fields, and only by understanding them (rather than simply focusing on abstract philosophical thought experiments) the reader can develop a proper assessment of the situation.


One key feature of the book that makes it unique is that it is multi-faceted in its incorporation of insights from various discussions present in legal, philosophical, and forensic  research, and in its implementation of the conceptual points by means of bayesian networks and \textbf{\textsf{R}} programming language.

## Outstanding Features List 

Briefly what you consider to be the outstanding, distinctive, or unique features of the work.


## Apparatus

a. Will the book include photographs, line drawings, cases, questions, problems, glossaries, bibliography, references, appendices, etc.?

b. If the book is a text, do you plan to provide supplementary material to accompany it? (Teacher's manual, study guide, solutions, answers, workbook, anthology, or other material.)


## Competition

a. Consider the existing books in this field and discuss specifically their strengths and weaknesses. Spell out how your book will be similar to, as well as different from, competing works.

b. Consider what aspects of topical coverage are similar to or different from the competition. What topics have been left out of competing books and what topics have been left out of yours?

c. Please discuss each competing book in a separate paragraph. (If possible, please provide us with the publisher and date of publication as well.) This information will provide the reviewers and the publisher a frame of reference for evaluating your material. Remember, you are writing for reviewers and not for publication, so be as frank as possible regarding your competition. Give credit where credit is due, and show how you can do it better.

# Market Considerations

## The Primary Market

1. What is the major market for the book? (Scholarly/professional, text, reference, trade?)

2. If this is a text, for what course is the book intended? Is the book a core text or a supplement? What type of student takes this course? What is the level? (Major or non-major; freshman, senior, graduate?) Do you offer this course yourself? If so, how many times have you given it? Is your text class-tested?

3. If the market is scholarly/professional, reference, or trade, how may it best be reached? (Direct mail, relevant journals, professional associations, libraries, book or music stores?) For what type of reader is your book intended?


# Status of the Work


1. Do you have a timetable for completing the book?
 
  a. What portion or percentage of the material is now complete?
 
 b. When do you expect to have a complete manuscript?
 
2. What do you estimate to be the size of the completed book?

a. Double spaced typewritten pages normally reduce about one-third when set in type; e.g., 300 typewritten pages make about 200 printed pages. There are about 450 words on a printed page.


b. Approximately how many photographs do you plan to include?


c. Approximately how many line drawings (charts, graphs, diagrams, etc. ) will you need?

d. Do you plan to include material requiring permission (text, music, lyrics, illustrations)? To what extent? Have you started the permissions request process?


3.  Do you plan to class-test the material in your own or other sections of the course? (Any material distributed to students should be protected by copyright notice on the material.)


# Sample Chapters

Select one or two chapters of the manuscript that are an integral part of the book. They should be those you consider the best-written ones, and do not have to be in sequence. For example, you might submit chapters 3, 7, and 14 of a 20-chapter book, so long as these chapters represent the content and reflect your writing style and pedagogy in the best possible light. It is also advisable to submit any chapter that is particularly innovative or unique. Sample chapters should contain rough sketches, charts, hand-written musical examples or xerox reproductions, and description of photographs to be included. The material need not be in final form, although it should be carefully prepared and represent your best work. In your preparation, emphasis should be on readability. Please do not bind your manuscript, as we will have to unbind it in order to make photocopies for reviewers. Also be sure all pages are numbered either consecutively or double-numbered by chapter.

# Reviews

If we are interested in your project, we will commission outside reviewers to read and evaluate your proposal. We will, of course, obtain the best available reviewers to consider your work. If you wish to suggest the names of experts in your field whom you believe to be ideally suited to evaluate your proposal, you may provide their names, titles, and email addresses. While we are unlikely to approach these scholars to act as reviewers themselves, we may ask them for their suggestions for peer readers. Naturally, we do not reveal the names of reviewers without their permission.

# Author Background

Please include a current CV or brief biography of your writing, teaching, and/or educational background and experience. Be sure to list any books that you have previously published, and any other information about yourself on why you are qualified to write this book.

# Response Time

Please allow at least 6-10 weeks for the manuscript proposal evaluation and review process. We will contact you as soon as we have had a chance to thoroughly examine your manuscript proposal. Thank you for your interest in Oxford University Press. We look forward to reading your materials.
