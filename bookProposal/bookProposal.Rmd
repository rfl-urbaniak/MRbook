# The Book

## Brief Description 

\footnotesize In one or two paragraphs, describe the work, including its rationale, approach, and pedagogy. (This book is... It does... Its distinguishing features are...)

\normalsize

This book boosts legal probabilism to its limits.\todo{Too boasty} The book shows that the simple 
version of the theory, what we dubbed legal probabilism 1.01,\todo{I still think this is a bit offensive towards many legal probabilists; Both "simple" and "1.01" are a bit too much.} falls prey to several difficulties. Either we reject legal probabilism altogether or we move past its simple version. By taking advatange of the theory of Bayesian networks, the book takes the latter route and develops legal probabilism 1.02. This more sophisticated theory improves on the limitations of the simple version and rivals in explanatory power two competing accounts of judicial fact-finding: argumentation theory and relative plausibility. To add great precision to the claims made in the book, the analytical argument is supplemented with an \textbf{\textsf{R}} code implementation.  

A prototype of legal probabilism 1.02 exists in the literature in forensic science and artificial intelligence. This prototype, however, needs further refinement. No comprehensive philosophical analysis exists of whether---and to what extent---legal probabilism 1.02 can meet the difficulties that plague legal probabilism 1.01. This book fills this lacuna in the literature. 

Besides breaking new grounds, the books aims to introduce unfamiliar readers to the rich interdisciplinary literature on legal probabilism, often scattered through journals and books in philosophy, law, computer science, forensic science and psychology.
Some chapters of the book presents original research and require  technical background in probability theory. Others are introductory, suitable for an advanced undergraduate class.

The book is aimed at philosophers interested in legal epistemology and epistemology more generally. Many of the difficulties of legal probabilism resemble difficulties faced by Bayesianism in epistemology. The book will draw attention outside philosophy from legal scholars who have championed applications of probability theory to evidence law as well as those who have resisted this trend. Another target audience includes computer scientists interested in modelling evidential reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.  

 


## Outline 


Part I of the book outlines legal probabilism 1.01 (Chapter 1) 
and its foes (Chapter 2). The 1.01 version comprises 
a familiar repertoire: Bayes' theorem, 
likelihood ratios, probability thresholds, expected utility 
maximization. This repertoire has proven useful in several ways, 
especially in the assessment of explicitly quantitative evidence 
such as DNA matches and other expert evidence. At the same time, 
legal probabilism 1.01 is liable to a host of conceptual difficulties: 
the conjunction problem, the problem of priors, paradoxes of naked statistical evidence. 
These difficulties are well-known. Others are less familiar: 
the problem of complexity, soft variables, the difficulty with corroboration. 
Part I will instill interest in the topic among unfamiliar readers and refresh the seasoned reader about 
the main points of contention. Part I provides the essential background for a 
deeper examination of legal probabilism 1.01 and the development of its 
more sophisticated version 1.02 which is undertaken in Part II and Part III. 

The remaining two parts of the book covers evidence assessment (Part II)
and decision-making (Part III). Legal probabilism is both a theory 
of evidence assessment as well as a theory of decision making at trial. 
These two facets are best kept separate for analytical clarity. 

Part II discusses in great detail three formal 
tools used for the assessment of evidence from a probabilistic 
perspective: Bayes' theorem, likelihood ratio and Bayesian network. 
This parts also discusses how these formal tools can 
be used to asessing evidence at trial, their strengths and limitations. 

Chapter 3 and 4 develop a unified argument, first illustrating the applications of legal probabilism 1.01 
and then examining its limitations as a theory of evidence assessment. More specifically, 
Chapter 3 presents Bayes' theorem and its simplest application, such as weighing one 
or two pieces of evidence. This approach is useful in many ways, for example, to avoid reaosoning fallacies such as the prosecutor's fallacy and base rate fallacy. But it also limited. Its limitations 
are discussed in Chapter 4. Most importantly, court cases often require fact-finders to weigh several pieces 
of evidence, sometimes conficting and liable to different intepretations. The hypotheses that the fact-finders 
are asked to evaluate in light of the evidence presented are structured stories 
or explanations of the evidence consituted by several sub-propositions. This level of complexity 
can hardly be modeled by a simple application of Bayes' theorem. A more sophisticated 
machinery for eviedence assessment is nedded. The more sophisticated 
machinery consists of Bayesian network. 

Before discussing Bayesian network, however, the book describes 
an approach that is, in some important way, an alternative to Bayes' theorem and that many legal probabilist 
have found very useful: likelihood ratio. Bayes' theorem rquires an asessment 
of prior probabilities, and assessing the prior probabilisties of hypothesies 
is notoriusly difficult. A simpler apapch only uses likelihood ratios. While this approach is 
still not able to model complex bodies of evidence, it has proven useful in many ways. 
Chapter 5 describe, in great detail, the likelihood approach, its applocation and stregthens. 
It also examines its weakeesses. 

Chapter 3, 4 and 5 combined sutiatated 
teh claim we need to move past legal 
probabilism 1.01. This task is accomplished 
in Chapter 6 through 9.

# Market Considerations

## The Primary Market

1. What is the major market for the book? (Scholarly/professional, text, reference, trade?)

2. If this is a text, for what course is the book intended? Is the book a core text or a supplement? What type of student takes this course? What is the level? (Major or non-major; freshman, senior, graduate?) Do you offer this course yourself? If so, how many times have you given it? Is your text class-tested?

3. If the market is scholarly/professional, reference, or trade, how may it best be reached? (Direct mail, relevant journals, professional associations, libraries, book or music stores?) For what type of reader is your book intended?


# Status of the Work


1. Do you have a timetable for completing the book?
 
  a. What portion or percentage of the material is now complete?
 
 b. When do you expect to have a complete manuscript?
 
2. What do you estimate to be the size of the completed book?

a. Double spaced typewritten pages normally reduce about one-third when set in type; e.g., 300 typewritten pages make about 200 printed pages. There are about 450 words on a printed page.


b. Approximately how many photographs do you plan to include?


c. Approximately how many line drawings (charts, graphs, diagrams, etc. ) will you need?

d. Do you plan to include material requiring permission (text, music, lyrics, illustrations)? To what extent? Have you started the permissions request process?


3.  Do you plan to class-test the material in your own or other sections of the course? (Any material distributed to students should be protected by copyright notice on the material.)


# Sample Chapters

Select one or two chapters of the manuscript that are an integral part of the book. They should be those you consider the best-written ones, and do not have to be in sequence. For example, you might submit chapters 3, 7, and 14 of a 20-chapter book, so long as these chapters represent the content and reflect your writing style and pedagogy in the best possible light. It is also advisable to submit any chapter that is particularly innovative or unique. Sample chapters should contain rough sketches, charts, hand-written musical examples or xerox reproductions, and description of photographs to be included. The material need not be in final form, although it should be carefully prepared and represent your best work. In your preparation, emphasis should be on readability. Please do not bind your manuscript, as we will have to unbind it in order to make photocopies for reviewers. Also be sure all pages are numbered either consecutively or double-numbered by chapter.

# Reviews

If we are interested in your project, we will commission outside reviewers to read and evaluate your proposal. We will, of course, obtain the best available reviewers to consider your work. If you wish to suggest the names of experts in your field whom you believe to be ideally suited to evaluate your proposal, you may provide their names, titles, and email addresses. While we are unlikely to approach these scholars to act as reviewers themselves, we may ask them for their suggestions for peer readers. Naturally, we do not reveal the names of reviewers without their permission.

# Author Background

Please include a current CV or brief biography of your writing, teaching, and/or educational background and experience. Be sure to list any books that you have previously published, and any other information about yourself on why you are qualified to write this book.

# Response Time

Please allow at least 6-10 weeks for the manuscript proposal evaluation and review process. We will contact you as soon as we have had a chance to thoroughly examine your manuscript proposal. Thank you for your interest in Oxford University Press. We look forward to reading your materials.
