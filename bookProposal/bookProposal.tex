This book boosts legal probabilism to its limits. The book shows that
the simplest version of the theory, legal probabilism 1.01, falls prey
to several difficulties. Either we reject legal probabilism altogether
or we move past its 1.01 version. This book takes the latter route. The
bulk of the book develops a more sophisticated version, legal
probabilism 1.02, that improves on the limitations of the simpler
version. This more sophisticated theory rivals in explanatory power two
competing accounts of judicial fact-finding: argumentation theory and
relative plausibility. To strengthen the argument with greater
precision, the conceptual developments in the book will be accompanied
by an \textbf{\textsf{R}} code implementation.

A prototype of legal probabilism 1.02 exists in the literature in
forensic science and artificial intelligence. But this prototype needs
further refinement and no comprehensive analysis exists of whether and
to what extent legal probabilism 1.02 can meet the difficulties that
plaugue legal probabilism 1.01. This book fills these lacunae.

The main audience of the book are philosophers interested in legal
epistemology and epistemology more generally. Many of the difficulties
of legal probabilism resemble difficulties faced by Bayesianism in
epistemology. The book will draw attention outside philosophy from legal
scholars who have championed applications of probability theory to
evidence law as well as those who have resisted this trend. Another
audience includes computer scientists interested in modelling evidential
reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.

Some chapters of the book presents original research and require
technical background in probability theory. Others are introductory,
suitable for an advanced undergraduate class. Besides breaking new
grounds, the books aims to introduce unfamiliar readers to the rich
interdisciplinary literature on legal probabilism, often scattered
through journals and books in philosophy, law, computer science,
forensic science and psychology.

\hypertarget{outline}{%
\subsection{Outline}\label{outline}}

Part I of the book outlines legal probabilism 1.01 (Chapter 1) and its
foes (Chapter 2). The 1.01 version comprises a familiar reportoire:
Bayes' theorem, likelihood ratios, probability thresholds, expected
utility maximization. This repertoire has proven useful in several ways,
especially in the assessment of explicitly quantitative evidence such as
DNA matches and other expert evidence. At the same time, legal
probabilism 1.01 is liable to a host of conceptual difficulties: the
conjunction problem, the problem of priors, paradoxes of naked
statistical evidence. These difficulties are well-known. Others are less
familiar: the problem of complexity, soft variables, the difficulty with
corroboration. Part I should create interest in the topic among
unfamiliar readers and refresh the seasoned reader about some of the
main points of contention. Part I provide the essential bacground for a
deeper examination of legal probabilism 1.01 and the development of its
more sophisticated version 1.02 in Part 2 and Part 3.

An important distinction to make is between evidence assessment and
decision-making. Legal probabilism is both a theory of evidence
asessment\\
as well as a theory of decision making at trial. These two facest are
best kept separate for analytical clarity. Part 2 is devoted to evidence
asessment and Part 3 to decision-making.

Legal probabilism 1.02 adds Bayesian networks to the familiar
reportoire. With this addition, notions familiar in argumention theory
such as undercutting and rebutting defeaters, as well as notions from
the relative plausibility theory such as specificity, plausibility and
coherence, can be formalized in the language of probability theory.

\hypertarget{sample-chapters}{%
\section{Sample Chapters}\label{sample-chapters}}

Select one or two chapters of the manuscript that are an integral part
of the book. They should be those you consider the best-written ones,
and do not have to be in sequence. For example, you might submit
chapters 3, 7, and 14 of a 20-chapter book, so long as these chapters
represent the content and reflect your writing style and pedagogy in the
best possible light. It is also advisable to submit any chapter that is
particularly innovative or unique. Sample chapters should contain rough
sketches, charts, hand-written musical examples or xerox reproductions,
and description of photographs to be included. The material need not be
in final form, although it should be carefully prepared and represent
your best work. In your preparation, emphasis should be on readability.
Please do not bind your manuscript, as we will have to unbind it in
order to make photocopies for reviewers. Also be sure all pages are
numbered either consecutively or double-numbered by chapter.

\hypertarget{reviews}{%
\section{Reviews}\label{reviews}}

If we are interested in your project, we will commission outside
reviewers to read and evaluate your proposal. We will, of course, obtain
the best available reviewers to consider your work. If you wish to
suggest the names of experts in your field whom you believe to be
ideally suited to evaluate your proposal, you may provide their names,
titles, and email addresses. While we are unlikely to approach these
scholars to act as reviewers themselves, we may ask them for their
suggestions for peer readers. Naturally, we do not reveal the names of
reviewers without their permission.

\hypertarget{author-background}{%
\section{Author Background}\label{author-background}}

Please include a current CV or brief biography of your writing,
teaching, and/or educational background and experience. Be sure to list
any books that you have previously published, and any other information
about yourself on why you are qualified to write this book.

\hypertarget{response-time}{%
\section{Response Time}\label{response-time}}

Please allow at least 6-10 weeks for the manuscript proposal evaluation
and review process. We will contact you as soon as we have had a chance
to thoroughly examine your manuscript proposal. Thank you for your
interest in Oxford University Press. We look forward to reading your
materials.
