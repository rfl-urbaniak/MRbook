\section{The Book}\label{the-book}

\subsection{Brief Description}\label{brief-description}

In one or two paragraphs, describe the work, including its rationale,
approach, and pedagogy. (This book is\ldots{} It does\ldots{} Its
distinguishing features are\ldots{})

\subsection{Outline}\label{outline}

A detailed outline of the book should be prepared, including the
chapters being submitted for review. This gives us an idea of how the
material fits together, and how the remaining chapters will be
developed. It should include chapter headings and sub-headings, with
explanations as necessary.

\subsection{Outstanding Features List}\label{outstanding-features-list}

Briefly what you consider to be the outstanding, distinctive, or unique
features of the work.

\subsection{Apparatus}\label{apparatus}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Will the book include photographs, line drawings, cases, questions,
  problems, glossaries, bibliography, references, appendices, etc.?
\item
  If the book is a text, do you plan to provide supplementary material
  to accompany it? (Teacher's manual, study guide, solutions, answers,
  workbook, anthology, or other material.)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Competition}\label{competition}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Consider the existing books in this field and discuss specifically
  their strengths and weaknesses. Spell out how your book will be
  similar to, as well as different from, competing works.
\item
  Consider what aspects of topical coverage are similar to or different
  from the competition. What topics have been left out of competing
  books and what topics have been left out of yours?
\item
  Please discuss each competing book in a separate paragraph. (If
  possible, please provide us with the publisher and date of publication
  as well.) This information will provide the reviewers and the
  publisher a frame of reference for evaluating your material. Remember,
  you are writing for reviewers and not for publication, so be as frank
  as possible regarding your competition. Give credit where credit is
  due, and show how you can do it better.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Market Considerations}\label{market-considerations}

\subsection{The Primary Market}\label{the-primary-market}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  What is the major market for the book? (Scholarly/professional, text,
  reference, trade?)
\item
  If this is a text, for what course is the book intended? Is the book a
  core text or a supplement? What type of student takes this course?
  What is the level? (Major or non-major; freshman, senior, graduate?)
  Do you offer this course yourself? If so, how many times have you
  given it? Is your text class-tested?
\item
  If the market is scholarly/professional, reference, or trade, how may
  it best be reached? (Direct mail, relevant journals, professional
  associations, libraries, book or music stores?) For what type of
  reader is your book intended?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Status of the Work}\label{status-of-the-work}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Do you have a timetable for completing the book?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  What portion or percentage of the material is now complete?
\item
  When do you expect to have a complete manuscript?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  What do you estimate to be the size of the completed book?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Double spaced typewritten pages normally reduce about one-third when
  set in type; e.g., 300 typewritten pages make about 200 printed pages.
  There are about 450 words on a printed page.
\item
  Approximately how many photographs do you plan to include?
\item
  Approximately how many line drawings (charts, graphs, diagrams, etc. )
  will you need?
\item
  Do you plan to include material requiring permission (text, music,
  lyrics, illustrations)? To what extent? Have you started the
  permissions request process?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Do you plan to class-test the material in your own or other sections
  of the course? (Any material distributed to students should be
  protected by copyright notice on the material.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample Chapters}\label{sample-chapters}

Select one or two chapters of the manuscript that are an integral part
of the book. They should be those you consider the best-written ones,
and do not have to be in sequence. For example, you might submit
chapters 3, 7, and 14 of a 20-chapter book, so long as these chapters
represent the content and reflect your writing style and pedagogy in the
best possible light. It is also advisable to submit any chapter that is
particularly innovative or unique. Sample chapters should contain rough
sketches, charts, hand-written musical examples or xerox reproductions,
and description of photographs to be included. The material need not be
in final form, although it should be carefully prepared and represent
your best work. In your preparation, emphasis should be on readability.
Please do not bind your manuscript, as we will have to unbind it in
order to make photocopies for reviewers. Also be sure all pages are
numbered either consecutively or double-numbered by chapter.

\section{Reviews}\label{reviews}

If we are interested in your project, we will commission outside
reviewers to read and evaluate your proposal. We will, of course, obtain
the best available reviewers to consider your work. If you wish to
suggest the names of experts in your field whom you believe to be
ideally suited to evaluate your proposal, you may provide their names,
titles, and email addresses. While we are unlikely to approach these
scholars to act as reviewers themselves, we may ask them for their
suggestions for peer readers. Naturally, we do not reveal the names of
reviewers without their permission.

\section{Author Background}\label{author-background}

Please include a current CV or brief biography of your writing,
teaching, and/or educational background and experience. Be sure to list
any books that you have previously published, and any other information
about yourself on why you are qualified to write this book.

\section{Response Time}\label{response-time}

Please allow at least 6-10 weeks for the manuscript proposal evaluation
and review process. We will contact you as soon as we have had a chance
to thoroughly examine your manuscript proposal. Thank you for your
interest in Oxford University Press. We look forward to reading your
materials.
