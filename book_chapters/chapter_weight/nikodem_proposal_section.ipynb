This can be mathematically represented as $f(p(x))$. This construct effectively maps weights to their respective hypotheses by adding another layer of probabilities in the form of a probability density function, rather than using less modest approaches like extending the set of hypotheses with a variable representing the weight of the hypotheses.\n",
