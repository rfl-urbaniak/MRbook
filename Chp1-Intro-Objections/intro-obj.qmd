We present the theory of legal probabilism, discuss several objections against it and outline a number of responses available to the legal probabilist.



# Probability thresholds 


Witnesses are called to testify in court about questions relevant to the defendant's civil or criminal liability. They can be lay people testifying about what they saw or heard. Or they can be experts testifying about results of laboratory testing or general scientific knowledge. As they testify, 
they are examined and cross-examined by the lawyers of the two parties. The rules of evidence and trial procedure frame how evidence should be presented and place restrictions on certain forms of information, for example, hearsay evidence is often considered inadmissible. Within these legal constraints, the purpose of the examination and cross-examination of witnesses is to ascertain whether the defendant engaged in behaviour or committed acts that are prohibited by the applicable law.  To put it somewhat crudely, the question to be answered  is, did the defendant did it or not? Only if the overall evidence is strong enough to establish that the defendant did it, the defendant should be found liable. 

The evidence is strong enough when it meets the governing burden of proof. This burden is usually different in civil or criminal cases. In civil cases, the burden of proof is 'preponderance of the evidence (sometimes also called 'balance of probabilities'); in criminal cases, the burden of proof is 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt'. The latter is meant to be more stringent than the former.

According to legal probabilism, the burden of proof is a probability threshold applied to the probability of liability. This is the probability, based on the evidence presented in court, that the defendant committed the unlawful acts or engaged in the unlawful behavior they are accused of. So, according to legal probabilism, if this probability is sufficiently high, the decision should be against the defendant, and otherwise it should favor the defendant. 

How stringent the threshold should be---51 percent, 99 percent or what?---is a function of maximizing expected benefits and minimizing expected costs. We can think of the costs as externalities associated with false positive and false negative decisions. The benefits, instead, are those that flow from true positive and true negative decisions. Typically, since the cost of a false positive---judging the defendant liable when they are not---is greater in criminal than  civil trials, the probability threshold is set higher in criminal trials. This agrees with the fact that 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' is more stringent that 'preponderance of the evidence'.


This probabilistic picture of the burden of proof is not uncontroversial, as we shall soon seen. But it has some plausibility, especially in civil trials. So it is worth exploring it more closely. 

According to a simple version of legal probabilism, the defendant's liability is established by the balance of probabilities---the burden of proof governing civil trials---provided the defendant's liability, based on the evidence presented, is greater than 50 percent or greater than .5. That is, if $L$ stands for 'the defendant is liable' and $E$ stans for the total evidence presented via examination and cross-examination, the burden of proof is formulated as follows:

\begin{quote}
find against the defendant if $P(L \vert E)>.5$ 
\end{quote}

\noindent
The word 'liability' can seem unspecific. The defendant is accused of having committed a specific set of acts or behaviors that, according to the applicable law, count as impermissible. For example, the act of driving and the act of driking alchool, in close temporal sucession one after the other, make one liable of driving under the influence. To represent liability at a more fine-grained level, let $H_A$ denote the theory or hypothesis against the defendant, the accusation theory, and $\neg H_A$ its negation. The accusation theory should  have some degree of specificity. It should not simply be the assertion that, say, the defendant drove under the influence. It should also say when, where and how the defendant drove under the influence. How specific the accusation theory should be is a question we will investigate later. 

So, if $E$ is the total evidence presented in court and $H_A$ is the accusation theory, 
the burden of proof in civil cases can be formulated as follows: 

\begin{quote}
find against the defendant if $P(H_A \vert E)> .5$ or if $P(H_A \vert E)> P(\neg H_A \vert E)$ 
\end{quote}

\noindent
The two formulations are equivalent because, if 
$P(H_A \vert E)>.5$, then $P(\neg H_A \vert E)<.5$ and thus also $P(H_A \vert E)> P(\neg H_A \vert E)$. The converse also holds. 



How is 'probability' to be understood in speaking of the probability of liability or the probability that the defendant did this and that? It cannot be a long-run frequency because the acts the defendant committed or not, are not repeatable events. It cannot be an objective chance either becuase, as a matter of fact, the defendant either committed those acts or did not. They lie somewhere in the past. Either they occurred or they did not. So the probability of liability must reflect the extent to which the evidence presented in court supports the claim that the defendant committed the unlawful acts they are accused of. The probability of liability must be evidence-relative. It must be an epistemic probability of some kind.

The metaphor of a scale can be helpful. Evidence may tip the scale in one direction or the other. Evidence can point against the defendant, making it more probable that that the accusation theory is true. Or it can point in favor of the defendant, making it less probable that the accusation theory is true. The overall balance of the scale, based on the total evidence, is the probability that the accusation theory is true.

So, legal probabilism is committed to at least one of the following tenets:

- the probability of liability can be assessed with some degree of precision

- the probability of liability is a good, theorethically adequate measure of the overall uncertanity about the disputed factual issue

\noindent
Legal probabilists could give up the first while still mantaining the second tenet. We will show that both these tenets are questionable. The metaphor of a scale tilting on one side or othe other is good only up to a point. How do we move past the metaphor? 


# Challenge: Where do the numbers come from? 


The posterior probability of liability, assessed on the basis of the evidence presented, is determined starting from a prior or initial value, assessed prior to considering the evidence. Typically, the prior probability is equated to $P(L)$, while the posterior probability, given evidence $E$, is equated to  $P(L \vert E)$.  The relation between prior and posterior is set by the well-known formula of Bayes' theorem:

$$P(L \vert E)=\frac{P(E \vert  L)}{P(E)}P(L)=\frac{P(E \vert  L)}{P(L)P(E\vert L)+P(\neg L)P(E\vert \neg L)}P(L)$$

The generic $L$ could be replaced by the more specific accuasation theory $H_A$, but to keep the notation easier to read, we will stick to $L$. 

Here legal probabilism faces the first major challange: \textit{Where do the numbers come from?} This challenge comes in many forms. Let us start with the problem of assessing prior probabilities. 

The prior probability $P(L)$ must be set somewhere, but where? Should the prior be $1/n$, where $n$ is the number of individuals who could have committed the unlawful acts in question? Setting $P(L)=1/n$ makes sense in a criminal case in which the identity of the perpertrator is disputed. Absent information for distinguishing $n$ possible perpetrators---prior to considering the trial evidence $E$---it is natural to set the prior probability $P(L)$ to $1/n$ since any of them could be the perpetrator.  But $1/n$ does not make sense in other contexts, criminal or civil, in which the identity of the person who committed the acts isn't disputed. What is disputed, rather, is how the acts exactly unfolded and so whether they amount to illegal conduct after all. In such cases, the prior could be $1/s$, where $s$ is the number of possible ways the events could have unfolded. But while it is clear how to count $n$ possible suspects,  it is less clear how to count $s$ possible ways in which the events could have unfolded.

The challenge does not stop at assessing prior probabilities. What numbers should be assigned to $P(E \vert L)$ and $P(E \vert \neg L)$? The answer is far from clear. As a first step, it can be helpful to break down $L$ into smaller level statements, say, whether the defendant visited the crime scene or left a blood stain at the scene. It can also be helpful to break down $E$ into smaller pieces: fingerprint evidence, witness testimonies, genetic matches, expert reports, etc. Once the statements are broken down this way, assigning probabilities to them becomes more manageable. 

For example, let $M$ stand for 'the defendant's genetic profile matches the crime traces' and $S$ stand for 'the defendant is the source of the crime trace'. The original formula reduces to the more manageable:

$$P(S \vert M)=\frac{P(M \vert  S)}{P(M)}P(S)=\frac{P(M \vert  S)}{P(C)P(M\vert S)+P(\neg C)P(M\vert \neg S)}P(C),$$

where the general level statement $L$ is replaced by $C$ and the overall evidence $E$ by the match evidence $M$. As we will see later, 
 $P(M \vert S)$ can be set to one and $P(M \vert \neg S)$ to the genotype probability, the expected frequency of finding the matching genotype in a reference population. The details do not matter now. The point is that these numbers can now be assigned following well-established procedures.  Finally, after setting $P(C)=1/n$, where $n$ is the number of possible contributors, the posterior probability $P(C \vert M)$ is obtained by easy calculations. 

The strategy of focusing on smaller level statements makes it possible to assign probabilities.  But it also pushes the problem elsewhere. Granted, probabilities can be assigned to smaller level statements such as $M$ and $S$, but what about general level statements such as $L$ or $H_A$? The objective of a trial is not just to ascertain whether the defendant is a source of the traces found at the scene, but whether the defendant is ultimately liable. 

 Legal probabilists are not empty-handed here. They rely on Bayesian networks to map out complex cases involving multiple propositions and multiple pieces of evidence. These networks serve to draw the connection between smaller level propositions, such as $S$ and $M$, and general level ones, such as $L$ and $H_A$. We will see how they work and how they are built in later chapters. The key idea suffices for now. The items of evidence and disputed propositions in a simple criminal case can be graphically represented as follows: $W \leftarrow L \rightarrow S \rightarrow M$,  \textbf{DRAW BAYES NET HERE}  where the letters $L, S$ and $M$ are interpreted as before. In addition, let $W$ stand for an incriminating eyewitness testimony, say the testimony that they saw the defendant run away from from the scene at the relevant time. 

  This network represents a case in which match evidence ($M$) supports the claim that the defendant left traces at the  scene ($S$). In turn, this latter claim supports the ultimate, general level claim $L$ that the defedant is liable. The witness testimony ($W$) supports $L$ directly. Given this set up, the probability of $L$ given both $M$ and $W$ is what we are interested in, $P(L \vert M \& W)$. What number should we attach to it?

Even such simple Bayesian network will need several conditional probabilities to get the calculations going.  It will need, for example, the conditional probabilities $P(S \vert L)$ and $P(S\vert \neg L)$. That is, if the defendant is liable (or not liable), how probable is it that they would be leaving traces at the  scene? The network will also need the conditional probabilities $P(W \vert L)$ and $P(W \vert \neg L)$. That is, if the defendant is liable (or not liable), how probable is it that they would be seen running away from the scene? These probabilities must be entered in the probability tables associated with the network. Presumably, $P(S \vert L)$ must be greater than $P(S \vert \neg L)$ and $P(W \vert L)$ greater than $P(W\vert \neg G)$. But besides these inequalities, what else?  

All in all, Bayesian networks do not solve the problem of how to assign the numbers. If anything, they make the problem more apparent. It is difficult to find all the numbers required  by the probability tables of a Bayesian network even in  simple networks, with just few nodes making up the network. When Bayesian networks consist of several propositions and items of evidence, the problem is even starker.  So, then, the required numbers are often inserted as educated guesses because the probability tables cannot be left blank.


Legal probabilists could respond in different ways. Here are some:

- \textit{Imprecision and intervals:} Instead of precise numbers, it is possible to rely on intervals or ranges of plausible probabilities. This is known as imprecise legal probabilism. There are Bayesian networks that can work with imprecise probabilities. Similarly, sensitivity analysys is used to test how the probability of the ultimate proposition $L$ or $H_A$$ varies in light of ranges of values for the probabilities of other, smaller level propositions.  


- \textit{Bite the bullet:} Yes, we do not currently have all the numbers we need, and that is a good reason to figure out what they are and collect relevant data. If the numbers are missing, then we do not currently have a good, precise way to quantify uncertainty. This isn't a problem for legal probabilism; it is a problem for any procedure that attempts to ascertain  disputed matters of fact. Legal probabilism has the merit to tell us what is missing. 

- \textit{Localize:} We can focus on those domains, propositions or forms of evidence for which the required numbers are available, for example, match genetic evidence or other forms of scientific evidence. Legal probabilism need not aspire to model the evidence of an entire legal case, but only evidence amenable to probabilistic quantification. 

- \textit{Qualitative:} While precise numbers can be helpful, they can also be a distraction. Even without delivering precise numbers, legal probabilism is still valuable. It forces us to focus on the logic of reasoning under uncertainty. Probability theory imposes coherence constraints on our evidence-based beliefs about uncertain events. Similarly, legal probabilism imposes coherence constraints on evidence-based beliefs about civil and criminal liability. Legal probabilism is not primarily concerned with the task of arriving at precise probabilities. They can still be useful for illustrative purposes, but should not be taken as a basis for making decisions. 

# Challenge: not just high probability 

Even if the numerical challenge can be addressed in one of the ways just outlined, other difficulties linger for legal probabilism.  Why aim to ascertain the probability of liability? Is this the right metric to focus on? Intuitively, if the probability of liability were low---assuming that probability is established somewhow---that would be a good reason to pause and not find the defendant liable. There is little doubt about that. But this intuition only shows that a high enough probability of liability is a \textit{necessary} condition for a finding of liability. Is it also a sufficient condition? That is less obvious. In fact, we can think of cases in which---intuitively---the probability of liability is high enough, yet the supporting evidence is weak, insufficient to sustain a judgment against the defendant.

A civil suit is brought against someone to recover a certain amount of money. This is a cae of civil theft and the governing standard is preponderance or balance of probabilities. The evidence is that a rumor suggests  the defendant embezzeled money from the plaintiff. Without any specific evidence about what happaned, the starting point is equipoise between $H_A$ and its negation. That is, $P(H_A)=P(\neg H_A)$. As the rumor $R$ is added as evidence, the balance tilts towards $H_A$, if only so slightly. So, $P(H_A \vert R)>P(\neg H_A \vert R)$. But it would be ridiculous---on such tenous evidence!---to conclude that the defendant should be liable of embezzelment. A case like this should not even be litigated in court.

This counterintuitive depends on the assumption that, without any specific evidence, $P(H_A)=P(\neg H_A)$. But rejecting this assumption does not help. For suppoose that, as a starting point, $H_A$ has a much, much lower probability than its negation, say about 1 percent. Then, $\neg H_A$ will have an extremely high probability. But it is absurd to say that, without any evidence, $\neg H_A$---or any other hypothesis---is extremely likely. If there is no evidence for it, how could it be extremely likely? Perhaps this reasoning makes an error. The prior $P(\neg H_A)$ is high because embezzelment---thank God!---isn't that frequent in the general population. So, relying on baseline, general information is enough to make $P(\neg H_A)$ extremely unlikely.

This response is not satisfactory either. Take someone who has embezzeled money often in the past. For this individual, the prior $P(H_A)$ is actually 50:50. Now, just a slight rumor that they did it again this time, would be enough to ensure $P(\neg H_A)$ jumps above .5, if only so slightly. But again finding this person liable of embezzelment---in this specific instance---should give us pause. Or take a cae in which a sum of money has disappeared and there are only two suspects. A rumor against one of them is enough to ensure that $P(\neg H_A)$ exceeds .5, but again a rumor is too tenous evidence to sustain a judgment of liability. 






























Besides high probability, other dimensions (should) guide decision-making and they might not be reducible to the probability of liability. Some of these other dimensions are:

- How certain are we about the probability of liability? (Higher-order uncertainty) 

- How good (specific, coherent, plausible, explanatory powerful) is the story presented?

- Did the defense challenged the other party's story? Did the story survive the challenges?

- Is any evidence missing? Is the evidence presented representative of both sides or was the evidence collected in a biased or skewed manner?

A more sophisticated version of legal probabilism, then, should be able to 
do at least two things: first, formally model these additional dimension using the language of probability (or determine to what extent they fall outside the scope of probability theory and cognate theories); and second, show why relying on these additional dimensions in decision-making does foster important values, such as the accuracy and fairness of trial decisions.


\textbf{NEED TO EXPLAIN EACH POINT MORE CLEARLY}



# Comparative thresholds

We pause our examination of legal probabilism and outline an alternative theory, relative plausibility. This is can be used a contrast for the discussion of legal probabilism. The starting point of relative plausiblility is that at trial the two parties put forward competing explanations of the evidence, and then these competing explanations are tested against the evidence. The explanation that is more plausible in light of the evidence prevails. So the judgment of liability should follow the explanation that prevails.  Think of the two competing explanations as the accusation theory $H_A$ and a defebnse theory $H_D$. Instead of assessing the probability of $H_D$ or $H_D$ in light of the evidence $E$, the theory of relative plausibility submit that the point of legal fact-find to assess the plausibility of $H_A$ relative to $H_D$ in light of evidence $E$. Plausibility is a multidimensional notion, comprising considerations of fit and consistency with the evidence, predictive power, logical coherence, coverage of the evidence, etc. The more plausible explanation is one that prevails along a weighted combination of these criteria. 

To articulate the idea of plausible more precise woud us too far afield. But one aspect of relative plausibility can be immediuately grasped: instead of focusing on just the acusation $H_A$, focus on the comparison of the accusation theory against its alternative $H_D$. This comparative idea can be adopted by legal probabilism. It is worth examining what comes out.

Legal probabilism is a flexible theory. What if $\neg H_a$ is replaced by a more specific hypothesis alternative to $H_A$, call it $H_D$, say the theory put foward by the defense? While $H_D$ entails $\neg H_A$, becuase $H_D$ and $H_A$ must be incompatible, the converse does not hold. $\neg H_A$ does not entail $H_D$ becuase $H_D$ is just one particular way in which $H_A$ can fail to hold. 

So, the burden of proof in civil cases can now be formulated as follows (call it the comparative formulation): 

\begin{quote}
find against the defendant if $P(H_A \ vert E)> P(H_D \vert E)$. 
\end{quote}

\noindent
In other words, to establish the defendant's liability by the balance of probabilities, the accusation theory $H_A$ should be more probable than the defense theory. Crucially, the condition $P(H_A \ vert E)> P(H_D \vert E)$ is not equivalent to $P(H_A \ vert E)> .5$ seen earlier. It could be that both $H_A$ and $H_D$ have probability below .5, even though $H_A$ is more probable than $H_D$. So, following this comparative formulation, a defendant could be found liable even though the probability of liability is below .5. This result seems counterintuitive, and perhpas it is a reason to favor the earlier, non-comparative formulation of the burden of proof. 

A related reason to be cautious of the comparative formulation is that the resultig decision rule depends on the choice of $H_A$ and $H_D$. It is possible that, given the same stock of evidence $E$, in one case the probability of $H_A$ exeecds that of $H_D$, while in another case, given a different framing of the two theories, the probability of $H_D$ execeeds that of $H_A$.  This result signals a worrisome level of sujbectivity in the decision rule.


## Challenge 2: Evidence is evaluated holistically. 

\textit{The chapter on story coherence should address this challange.} 


## Challenge 3: Learning isn't updating 

Ronald Allen complains that Bayesian updating isn't an adequate model of what goes on in the courtroom when evidence is presented. The decision-makers do not start from priors and update them based on the pieces of evidence presented. What happens is more complicated and cannot be modeled by Bayesian updating. \textit{The chapter 
on cross-examination and arguments should address this challange.} 

## Challenge 4: Trials are adversarial 

Trials are often adversarial. Evidence is examined and cross-examined. How can this adversarial process be modeled probabilistically?
\textit{The chapter on cross-examination and arguments should address this challange.} 


## Challenge 5: No evidence that probability reduces errors 
It is clear that people make probabilistic mistakes in reasoning, but does this show that mistaken convictions are caused by these probabilistic mistakes? There is no evidence of that. In what way does probability actually improve the accuracy of legal decisions?
\textit{Discussion about accuracy and fairness should address this challange}

This more sophisticated version of 
legal probabilism should answer some of existing challenges to 
simple legal probabilism.
