# \S 0 **The Question**

Disputes about matters of fact in trial proceedings 
should be adjudicated in light of the evidence presented by the litigants. But, 
should the fact that some evidence was *not* presented also---at least in some 
circumstances---guide trial decisions? This is the 
problem of gaps in the evidence or the problem of missing evidence.^[By "missing evidence" I shall usually mean the known fact that some evidence is missing whose content is unknown.]

To illustrate, consider this scenario:

\begin{quote}
\textsc{Target:} A customer trips and falls in a Target store. They suffer a serious injury. They sue Target and seek to recover medical costs. They claim the floor was slippery. Target denies the allegation. Video surveillance footage is only preserved in part. The rest is deleted. It is impossible to reconstruct what happened before the incident. The plaintiff—the customer—seeks an adverse inference jury instruction against Target for failing to preserve the full recording.\footnote{The facts of this example follow (roughly) Decker v. Target Corp., No. 1:16-cv-00171-JNP-BCW (D. Utah Oct. 10, 2018). The adverse inference jury instruction would tell the jury to presume that the floor was slippery.}
\end{quote}


\noindent
\textit{Plan for the talk}: dismissive responses to the problem 
of missing evidence (\S 1); the legal
framework (\S 2); prejudice and reliability as two competing 
criteria (\S 3); epistemic and 
policy considerations in formualating remedies 
for missing evidence (\S 4); reliability and 
fortuitousness as key guiding criteria (\S 5).


# \S 1 **Dismissive Responses**


Some might claim that the problem of missing evidence is not a difficult problem and can be easily addressed: 
either (1) missing evidence is irrelevant and thus should play no role  in trial decisions, or (2) if it is relevant, it is just like any other evidence so it poses no peculiar problem. Let's consider each of these in turn.


(1) *Missing evidence is not relevant evidence*

\noindent
Missing evidence could be in favor or against either party. The two possibilities cancel each other out. So missing evidence is irrelevant:

> [I]f the evidence is missing it cannot be known which way it points. It appears equally possible that the missing evidence would confirm the current factual conclusion as contradict it. The competing possibilities cancel each other out. There is no warrant for the assumption that the missing evidence will point one way rather than the other.^[Hamer, D. (2012). Probability, Anti-resilience, and the Weight of Expectation. *Law, Probability and Risk*,
11(2-3), 135–158, 139.]

\noindent
This claim, however, cannot be right in general. For consider the \textsc{Target} example from the beginning. Presumably, Target would be more likely to delete the video if, say, the floor was slippery than if it was not. They have a reason to delete the recording in the former but not in the latter case. Thus, taking into account the fact the recording is missing should raise the probability that the floor was slippery. This shows that missing evidence can well be relevant evidence. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.fullwidth = FALSE, fig.cap="DAG of the Target case.", out.width = '100%'} 
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/mdibello/Desktop/Book-Legal-Prob/Evidence-Gaps/slippery-dag.png") 
```

The only case in which the missing video would have null value is if it were just as likely that  Target would attempt to remove the recording when the floor was slippery than when it was not.

(2) *Missing evidence is just any other kind of evidence*

\noindent
Let $E_p$ the evidence presented at trial and let $E_m$ describe known facts about missing evidence, for example, that the video recording is missing. The overall body of evidence should consist of $E_p \wedge E_m$. In making decisions about a hypothesis $H$, we should consider $Pr(H \vert E_p \wedge E_m)$ rather than simply $Pr(H \vert E_p)$.^[Kaye, D. H. (1986). Do we Need a Calculus of Weight to Understand Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt? *Boston University Law Review*, 66, 657–672.]

If missing evidence is relevant evidence, $Pr(H \vert E_p \wedge E_m) \neq Pr(H \vert E_p)$.\footnote{The only hard question here would be, how should one assess $Pr(H \vert E_p \wedge E_m)$ as opposed to $Pr(H \vert E_p)$, for example, following the causal graph in Figure 1?}
But can this be the whole story? Likely not. To see why not, 
let's take a look at the legal framework for handling missing evidence. 



# \S 2  **Legal Framework**


The legal framework for handling missing evidence is three-tiered:^[Case law in the United States often follows this framework. See e.g. Decker v. Target Corp., No. 1:16-cv-00171-JNP-BCW (D. Utah Oct. 10, 2018) or Howard v. United States, No. 18-CF-15, (District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Nov. 19, 2020).] 

 > First, ask about the *prejudicial effects* of the missing evidence. Could the missing evidence have made a difference to the verdict?^[A related question concerns what we might call *would-be-relevance*: would the missing evidence if presented be relevant? This question can be subsumed under the question of prejudice.]

> Second, examine the *circumstances*  that caused the evidence to be missing.  Was it an accident or misconduct? Did one of the parties have a duty to preserve the missing evidence?

> Third, devise a *remedy* (such as an adverse jury instruction) to be granted to the litigant disadvantaged by the missing evidence.


# \S 3  **Prejudice (or Reliability?)**

To better understand the notion of prejudice, below is an example from the case
law about missing evidence not regarded as prejudicial: 

> \textsc{Firearm:} Defendant is charged with illegal possession of firearm. The police legally searched the defendant’s
vehicle and found a firearm. The defendant had no permit. The police searches the rest of the car and finds a backpack, but does not retain all the items in the backpack: keys, pieces of paper, trash. The defense complains that the evidence is incomplete: information about the contents of the backpack is missing. In particular, defense argues that the keys could be exculpatory evidence: if they did not belong to the defendant, the backpack did not either, and neither did the firearm.^[Howard v. United States, No. 18-CF-15, (District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Nov. 19, 2020).]

\noindent
The Court reasoned that the inferences to be drawn from the missing evidence---for example, the missing keys---were 'wholly speculative' and thus the missing evidence was not prejudicial.^[This conclusion seems sensible. It would be odd if any missing piece of information---given a broad enough interpretation---could alter the balance of the evidence and thus be prejudicial.]



But, is prejudice the right criterion to focus on? Even if adding the missing evidence
could have changed the verdict (prejudice), this addition could have also lowered the reliability of the decision-making process.^[Define reliability as the weighted average of the sensitivity and specificity of a binary decision-making process (say, a gain in specificity can be valued twice as much as a gain in sensitivity).] In a slogan,
the claim "More Evidence, Fewer Errors" is not true in general.^[This is a challenge to the principle of total evidence. See, for example, Good, I. J. (1967). On the principle of total evidence. *British Journal for the Philosophy of Science*, 17(4), 319–321.] For consider this example:^[This example is liberally inspired by Lee Johnson v. Jeff Premo (2021 Oregon App. Ct.), Marion County Circuit Court08C11553 - A159635.]

> \textsc{More Evidence More Errors:} Reliable match evidence links the defendant to the crime scene in a murder case. There is no evidence, however, about the defendant’s whereabouts before or after the crime nor about who else visited the crime scene. Compare this case with one in which the same evidence is presented but---in addition---a neighbor testifies that another person visited the victim’s house before the defendant did. This additional evidence, though relevant, has a low probative value compared to the match evidence: the neighbor is an elderly man whose memory has proven unreliable in other circumstances. This testimony, if added, could change the verdict (prejudice) but would also make the decision process less reliabile than a decision based on just match evidence.^[Suppose match evidence is 99\% reliable, so $Pr(M^+ | G)=Pr(M^- \vert I)=.99$. Testimonial evidence in the case, instead, is only 51% reliable, so $Pr(T^+ | G)=Pr(T^- \vert I)=.51$. Decisions based on $M^{+/-}$ will be 99% reliable. Instead, decisions based on $M^{+/-}\wedge T^{+/-}$ will be less reliable. For sensitivity will be much worse than 99%, that is, $P(M^+ \wedge I^+ \vert G)=.99\times 0.51\approx .5$. The assumption here is that a conviction is issued only when both items of evidence are incriminating, $M^+\wedge T^+$. Specificity will be only slightly better than 99%, that is, $P(M^- \wedge I^- \vert I) + P(M^+ \wedge I^- \vert I) + P(M^- \wedge I^+ \vert G) \approx .995$.]

\noindent
Instead of focusing on prejudice, the question of reliability can become primary 
in deciding what to do about missing evidence:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Reliability First}: If the missing evidence, once added to the existing body of evidence, would have lowered the reliability of the decision—say because the missing evidence was, in an objective sense, misleading or with lower reliability—it should be disregarded. So, in cases of missing evidence, the question of reliability is primary. In procedural terms, absent any clear reason for thinking the missing evidence would enhance reliability, the missing evidence should be disregarded; otherwise, it should be taken into account.
\footnote{The alternative is \textbf{Prejudice First}: A defendant may benefit from evidence even if it is misleading so long as the evidence, assessed on its face, appears to favor the defendant and tips the overall balance of evidence in their favor. This applies to all defendants. So, in cases of missing evidence, the question of prejudice is primary. In procedural terms, absent any clear reason for thinking the missing evidence could turn the verdict around (prejudice), the missing evidence should be disregarded; otherwise, it should be taken into account.}
\end{quote}

\noindent
Some might object that evidence is routinely presented at trial that could be misleading or could lower the reliability of the decision-making process. So reliability cannot be the key criterion
for deciding whether further evidence should be taken into account. 

But there is an important difference. When evidence is *actually* presented in trial proceedings, it is subject to adversarial scrutiny and cross-examination. This process is intended to detect sources of unreliability in the evidence. Instead, missing evidence cannot be subject to adversarial testing since its content is unknown. This difference is well-understood in the case law:

> A primary function of jury instructions, as well as the rules of procedure and evidence, is to confine the jury’s attention to firsthand testimony ... which may be probed on cross-examination, thereby excluding conjecture ... The risk is always present that the jury will give undue weight to the presumed content of testimony not presented, and insufficient weight to that which was presented.^[Thomas v. United States, 447 A.2d 52, 58 (D.C. 1982).]

\noindent
How can this problem (i.e., giving undue weight to evidence not presented) be addressed? One option is to block any appeal to missing evidence since missing evidence cannot be tested via cross-examination. A less extreme option is to require that the missing evidence---despite not being testable adversarially---is shown to likely improve the reliability of the decision-making process. This is the rationale behind Reliability First.^[Interestingly, the missing evidence in the \textsc{Target} case would have clearly enhanced the reliability of the decision-making process. We can conjecture, then, that the law has a preference for cases in which (it is relatively clear that) the missing evidence, if added, would have improved reliability.]

# \S 4  **Circumstances and Remedies: Epistemology or Policy?**

We now turn to the question of how remedies 
for missing evidence should be devised. Two approaches can be identified:

\textbf{Epistemic aproach}: remedies should only follow a conscientiousness assessment of the evidence. That some evidence was not presented can itself be information (evidence) for drawing inferences together with other evidence that was presented. This approach is internal to the logic of evidence evaluation. So the remedy here only consists in adjusting the probability of a hypothesis given missing evidence, that is, $Pr(H \vert E_p)\neq Pr(H \vert E_p \wedge E_m)$.^[The epistemic response aligns with the dismissive response (2) in \S 1 according to which "Missing evidence is just any other kind of evidence".]

\textbf{Policy approach}: Gaps in the evidence can be the result of objectionable out-of-court behavior that must be sanctioned. 

The epistemic approach has limited applicability compared to the policy approach depending on the different circumstances in which gaps in the evidence arise. 
The two will not always converge:

\begin{quote}
\textit{Bad faith}: a party destroyed evidence with intent to benefit from the destruction.\footnote{Epistemic and policy approach yield the same remedy, say, an adverse inference against one party.}

\textit{Accident}:  by fortuitous circumstances, the evidence was destroyed.\footnote{The evidence is missing because of "random error", so no remedy required.}

\textit{Systemic patterns}: some parties have systemically less access to evidence than others (say, because of imbalances in resources).\footnote{Should the value of evidence presented  by the party that has better access to evidence be disocunted?}

\textit{Negligence}: a party had a duty to preserve the evidence, but failed to comply with existing standards.\footnote{
The epistemic approach would recommend no remedy. For consider this case. A man voluntarily confesses to having stabbed an elderly woman while attempting to stole money from her apartment. The man gives a detailed story about the incident. The man is tried for murder. The defense argues that the defendant’s confession is an attempt to cover for others. The defendant has two sons with a criminal record. But, since the defendant confessed, the police did not think it necessary to analyze the tin box that contained the money for fingerprints. The fact that forensic analyses of the tin box are missing cannot be used to make an inference that they must have been exculpatory. So the epistemic approach would recommend no remedy. Still, even without bad faith intent, there was negligence on the part of the police. The policy approach could recommend the case be decided for the defendant.}

\end{quote}
 





# \S 5  **Two Guiding Questions**

Two questions can guide how to respond to gaps in the evidence:

\begin{quote}
\textit{Reliability}: Compare the body of available evidence (with gaps) and the would-be body of evidence (without gaps). Do we have reasons to believe that the complete body would be more reliable than the body of available evidence?

\textit{Causes} What is the cause that brought about gaps in the evidence? Is it a fortuitous fact or the result of a systemic pattern that advantages one or the other party in the trial?
\end{quote}
