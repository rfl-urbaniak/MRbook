\section{Structure of paper}\label{structure-of-paper}}

First talk about some paradigmatic legal cases and established legal
framework to handle cases of missing evidence.

One: Salem trials. Here the content of the missing is know, so is it
really a case of missing evidence?

Two: Target case. Here tha there is missing evidence is clear (vida was
erased), but te question of the conten of the video is open.

Three: could there be other cases in which whether the evidence is
missing or not might depend on what kind of partisan story one
subscribes to? Or perhaps there might be conflicting stories about why
the evidence is missing.

Note that the legal framework only addresses cases of manifest missing
evidence --- cases in which (a) we know evidence is missing and (b) we
know why it is missing (e.g.~bad faith, negligence, etc.), so we need to
decide what to do with the information (a) and (b), (e.g.~draw an
adverse inference).

Two limitations of the legal framework: (1) if there is no bad faith
intent, then there is no adverse inference to be drawn; (2) given a
settled story about what happened, the story itself tells us some
evidence is missing. But could there other cases of missing
evidence---say more conjectural?

Beyond (1). Consider the case there is no bad faith intent, but the
evidence is still missing. What kind of remedy could address the gap in
this case? Humer's argument is that since the missing evidence could
point in both directions---guilt and innocence---the evidential value
should be dismissed. Missing evidence averages out and thus return the
same probability of guilt as the original evidence. This argument does
not seem correct. So challenge it.

Beyond (2). The even more difficult question is what to do when there is
story that clearly tells us that the evidence is missing, or it is not
clear that the evidence is missing. Here is the difference between the
express ``gaps'' and ``missing evidence'' start to matter. For example,
do you have a gap in the evidence if you have not considered evidence
about how reliable an eyewitness is? Yes and no. This aspects suggests
that evidence is open-ended and thus the problem gaps is less pressing.

\item
  Difference between gaps in a clearly defined story and generic gaps in
  the evidence. The former, when filled, would clearly make the decision
  making more accurate, while the latter could make it less accurate. So
  we need not obsess about gaps in general, but only gaps that are
  clearly articulated. Sp, a decision procedure with more evidence
  (filling clear gaps) is more accurate, but a decision procedure worth
  more evidence (not filling clear gaps) need not be more accurate. So
  conjectural gaps might be less important thazn clear narrative gaps.
\item
  Consider now only clearly specified gaps that are accuracy enhancing.
  Such gaps in evidence may be random/fortuitous or follow a systematic
  pattern. They only worrisome if they follow a systematic pattern. If
  they are random, they will reduce accuracy (because of 1), but not
  favor one side or the other systemically. So sucvh cases might not
  need any regulatations.
\item
  Two rationales for remedies: epistemic individual specific and policy
  rationale. First, if evidence was intentionally removed, it is likely
  it would favopr the other party, etc. here an inference about what the
  missing/removed evidence was likely is made. No appeal to policy.
  Instead, we can also device a policy that says: sanction behavior that
  destroyed evidence when it is in bad faith. The two approaches might
  converge byt might also diverge sometimes. Example: evidence
  destruction was by accident, but there was duty for the defendant to
  preserve evidence. So, epistemic individual approach would not draw
  any adverse inference, but the policy approach would.
\item
  Consider cases of missing stats about reliability of lab genetic
  testing or information about visibility conditions for eyewitness. Is
  this a clearly defined gap in the evidence or a generic gap?

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This much is uncontroversial about trial decision-making: disputes about
matters of fact should be adjudicated in light of the evidence presented
by the litigants. For example, suppose that a plaintiff sues a shop
owner because of an injury that occurred in the shop. The floor was
slippery. The plaintiff tripped and fell. They had a concussion. They
seek compensation for damages. This is the plaintiff's version of the
facts. The shop owner responds that the floor was not slippery. The
plaintiff did fall and had a concussion---this is undisputed---but not
because of the slippery floor. Plaintiff and defendant are disagreeing
about a question of fact. What happened, exactly, when the plaintiff
tripped and fell? Evidence must be presented by the litigants to resolve
the dispute.

But there is a complication. Suppose the shop had cameras inside. When
the plaintiff tripped and fell, the camera recorded what happened. The
recording, if accessible, could unequivocally tell what happened. This
is a settled fact. For some reason, however, the camera recording of
that specific incident had gone missing. There isn't much other evidence
that could be gathered, except conflicting testimonies by the plaintiff
and defendant. That day at that time no one else was in the shop. So,
merely based on the available evidence, the plaintiff would have a weak
case.

But this outcome would be, in some important way, unsatisfactory. Why
was the recording missing? The shop owner might have deleted it. They
feared the customer could sue them. If so, should the case be resolved
in favor of the plaintiff even though the available evidence does not
tip in their favor? Perhaps so. What if the recording was deleted
\emph{by accident}? Our intuitions might waver here. But, setting aside
how the case should be decided, the upshot is clear. Although the
evidence presented by the parties should generally guide trial
decisions, the fact that some evidence was \textit{not} presented should
also---in some circumstances---guide trial decisions. To examine what
these circumstances might be is the task of this paper. We call this the
problem of gaps in the evidence or missing evidence.

Legal systems of adjudication contain rules for handling gaps in the
evidence. These rules are elaborate, subtle, intricate. We are not
cataloging these rules, nor offering a comparative study of how
different systems of adjudication address the problem of gaps. Our aim
here is modest---that is, to map out the conceptual terrain. We will
examine a few paradigmatic examples of gaps in the evidence. We will
also discuss how epistemic and non-epistemic considerations can guide
the identification of gaps as well as how decision-makers should respond
to them.

\hypertarget{theoretical-framework}{%
\section{Theoretical framework}\label{theoretical-framework}}

In this section, we discuss the causes of incomplete evidence, and the
relationship between incompleteness and accuracy. We conclude this
section by identifying two questions that may guide responses to missing
evidence. This theoretical framework paves the way to the legal
framework in the next section.

\hypertarget{causes-of-gaps}{%
\subsection{Causes of gaps}\label{causes-of-gaps}}

To understand how gaps in the evidence come about, it important to
distinguish the problem of gaps from the problem of fallibility. Imagine
a system of adjudication that is immune from gaps in the evidence. The
system is both complete and infallible. It has access to evidence about
every possible fact at any time in any place and this evidence is
infallible. The problem of gaps does not arise here. But it is not the
infallibility of the system that eliminates the problem. For a fallible
legal system could still avoid the problem of gaps. Think of a complete
yet fallible system. It has access to evidence about every possible fact
at any time in any place. Yet the evidence could be erroneous. Say,
every action by any individual at any time in any place is recorded, and
the recording is accessible by the legal system. This is completeness.
But suppose recordings can be erroneous, say because the pixels can get
messed up and depict people doing what they were not doing. This is
fallibility: evidence may give a picture of the facts that does not
correspond to them. This complete yet fallible legal system would not
incur the problem of gaps, but would still incur the problem of
erroneous decisions. Recordings that show indication of error should
count as weaker evidence compared to recordings that did not show any
error. So the problem of gaps is not due to fallibility, but
incompleteness. A complete system of adjudication, then, has access to
every fact via at least one item of evidence, whether it be fallible or
infallible.\footnote{Facts can also be evidential facts---say whether
  evidence support some hypothesis and to what degree. So, completeness
  would require evidence about first-order facts, as well as evidence
  also about evidential facts, and and so on. This would create an
  infinite regress, which makes it difficult, even in principle, to have
  complete evidence. So a complete system of adjudication is very hard
  to come by.}

We have seen that completeness does not imply infallibility. One might
now wonder whether incompleteness implies fallibility. It does not. Say
the truth of some complex proposition \(A \wedge B \wedge C\) is under
dispute, and facts \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) are all there is to know. So
having evidence about the three of them would satisfy completeness.
Suppose there is infallible evidence that \(A\) holds and infallible
evidence that \(C\) holds, but no infallible evidence about \(B\).
Assume that \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) are independent, so evidence about
one is not---indirectly---evidence about the other.\footnote{In
  contrast, suppose that \(A, B\) and \(C\) form a temporally ordered
  series of events: \(A\) stands for forming an intention to do
  \(\varphi\); \(B\) stands for doing \(\varphi\); and \(C\) stands for
  bringing about a consequence of doing \(\varphi\). Since \(A\) and
  \(C\) are known for sure, \(B\) becomes more likely in light of \(A\)
  and \(C\). In fact, \(A\) and \(C\) are fallible evidence for \(B\).
  So, relative to \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\), the evidence is actually
  complete yet fallible, since the evidence about \(B\) is fallible.}
This system would be infallible (all the evidence that there is
infallible), yet incomplete (not every fact is evidenced by an item of
evidence). So incompleteness does not imply fallibility
either.\footnote{More generally, consider this set-up: every proposition
  in the set \(\Sigma\) is causally independent of any proposition in
  the set \(\Delta\). Suppose a system of adjudication has access to
  infallible evidence about all the facts described by the propositions
  in \(\Sigma\), but no evidence whatsoever about the facts described by
  the propositions in \(\Delta\). This system would be infallible, yet
  incomplete. There would be no fallible evidence.}

Incompleteness and fallibility are distinct concepts. In the world we
live in, however, any system of adjudication will be fallible and
incomplete. Fallibility and incompleteness are often intertwined. With a
better grasp of incompleteness, the first question is, why does a system
of adjudication fail to be complete---that is, fail to have access to
every fact? There could be several explanations.

First, some facts may not be evidentiable. For example, before genetic
testing was invented, the fact that a blood stain carried a genetic
profile was not evidentiable; it could not be translated into evidence.
Second, a fact may be evidentiable, but it was not the target of
evidence. For example, a blood stain was not analyzed or no witness
could see what happened inside the store when the customer tripped and
fell. A pressing problem with making an evidentiable fact an actual
target of evidence is that this process of evidence production might be
too expensive or time-consuming. Third, even if a fact is evidentiable
and was the target of evidence at some point, the resulting evidence
could not be retained, was destroyed or deteriorated significantly later
on. Say a video recording of what happened inside the store existed, but
was later deleted; perhaps it was too costly to keep it in storage.
Finally, even if a fact is evidentiable, was the target of evidence and
the evidence exists, it was not presented at trial. It might have been
too costly, time-consuming or practically impossible to present the
evidence. Say research shows the expert witness of the other side is
wrong, but presenting this research requires hiring a qualified expert
and the party does not have the time or resources to do that, or did not
consider this option.

Failure to make a fact a target of evidence, the destruction of the
evidence or failure to present evidence at trial could occur as mere
accidents or acts in bad faith---for example, when one of the litigants
in a trial had an interest in destroying the evidence. There are of
course variations in between these two extremes: nor was it accidental,
nor was it intentional but the destruction was due to someone's
negligence or failure to follow certain standards. The destruction may
also be mandated by a company's standards to minimize costs or by
competing interests, such as privacy.

\hypertarget{gaps-and-accuracy}{%
\subsection{Gaps and accuracy}\label{gaps-and-accuracy}}

When gaps in the evidence occur, the quality of adjudication seems to
deteriorate. But in what way, exactly, does it deteriorate? If there are
gaps, what is the problem with them? This question, however, is too
general. It does not specify the objectives that adjudication should
pursue. So, to narrow it down, assume that the primary goal of
adjudication is to make judgments about people's actions that are
factually correct---that is, to maximize true positives (say, convict
factually guilty people) and true negatives (say, acquit factually
innocent people).\footnote{We consider the goal of dispute resolution in
  footnote \ref{footnote:dispute-resolution}.} Given this assumption,
the question becomes: does the existence of gaps in the evidence make
the legal system less likely to reach accurate judgments?

In a sense, the answer to this question is obviously positive. Because
not every fact is reflected in evidence accessible to the legal system,
there will be criminal acts, frauds, infringements of rights etc. that
go undetected. In fact, most crimes go undetected, and some have
particularly low rates of prosecution. This is unsurprising, but a
matter that pertains more squarely to institutions outside the system of
adjudication itself, such as police investigation.

Consider now a narrower question. If a defendant stands accused in a
civil or criminal trial, does the fact that the evidence could be
incomplete make it more likely that an erroneous judgment would be
reached, either a false positive or false negative verdict? The answer,
once again, seems positive, but a closer scrutiny shows that the matter
is far from straightforward.

Suppose that favorable and unfavorable evidence to one of the parties is
always missing for fortuitous reasons---accidents---as well as
occasional bad faith acts of destruction of the evidence. This situation
is similar to when random errors, with no systemic pattern, occur in
large data collection (more on this later). When evidence is missing at
random, there is no reason to think that trial decisions would
necessarily be more error prone. True, in individual cases, gaps in the
evidence may cause errors. If exculpatory evidence ends up missing and
the defendant was actually innocent, an incorrect guilty verdict could
have been avoided had the exculpatory evidence not gone missing.
Conversely, if incriminating evidence ends up missing and the defendant
was actually guilty, an incorrect acquittal could have been avoided had
the incriminating evidence not gone missing. So gaps may cause mistaken
verdicts in individual cases. However, we should consider the long-term
accuracy of the adjudication system. Additional evidence, be
incriminating or exculpatory, could turn a would-be-correct-verdict into
an incorrect one. So gaps in the evidence need not be detrimental to
accuracy if they follow a random pattern. In fact, gaps in the evidence
may actually be accuracy-enhancing.

This claim can be illustrated with a simple model. First, consider the
following fallible and incomplete system of adjudication. Against each
trial defendants a body of (sometimes gappy) evidence is amassed.
Relying on the (sometimes incomplete) evidence available, the long-run
false positive rate (false conviction rate) is 30\% and the false
negative rate (false acquittal rate) also 30\%. In other words, this
legal system of adjudication---with occasional gaps in the
evidence---has true positive and true negative rates of 70\%. In
addition, the evidence presented against defendants fails to be complete
in 40\% of the cases \emph{at random}. There is no discernible systemic
pattern by which evidence goes missing. (The numbers are illustrative
and play no specific role in the argument that follows.)

Compare this fallible and incomplete system with one that is fallible
but complete. In those 40\% of cases in which completeness would fail,
this second system can supply complete evidence instead. Suppose the
presence of complete evidence makes a difference for trial decisions in
only half of those 40\% cases. So the two systems have the same 30\%
rate of false positives and false negatives in 80\% of the cases. The
difference is localized in 20\% of cases in which the added evidence
that fills the gaps makes a difference to the decision. In those cases,
the trial decision depends entirely on the added evidence that fills the
gaps. So the error rates in those cases boil down essentially to the
reliability of the added evidence---that is, how well the added evidence
tracks facts about guilt and innocence, specifically, the probability
the evidence is incriminating when the defendant is factually guilty
(true positive rate) and the probability it is exculpatory when the
defendant is factually innocent (true negative rate). Now, three
sub-cases must be distinguished. First, if the reliability of the added
evidence is greater than that of the body of evidence without the added
evidence, the complete system will have lower error rates. Second, if
the reliability of the added evidence is the same as that of the body of
evidence without the added evidence, the complete and incomplete systems
will have the same error rates. Finally---and this is the most important
case---if the reliability of the added evidence is lower than that of
the body of evidence without the added evidence, the complete system
will have higher error rates. So, adding missing evidence to fill gaps
need not improve the accuracy of trial decisions, and it may actually
diminish it in some circumstances.

We now have an answer to our question: how do gaps in the evidence
impact accuracy? Whenever the addition of the missing evidence would
have improved the reliability of the available evidence, gaps in the
evidence are regrettable, because they increase the error rates of the
decision system. However, whenever a body of evidence with gaps is not
any worse in terms of reliability than a complete body of evidence, gaps
in the evidence are not regrettable. If a body of evidence with gaps is
better in terms of reliability than a complete body of evidence, gaps in
the evidence are actually preferable.\footnote{Besides accuracy, another
  important goal of trial adjudication is the timely resolution of
  disputes. Interestingly, gaps in the evidence have the same
  double-sided impact on accuracy and dispute resolution. Gaps may
  enhance or diminish accuracy, and similarly, they may favor or hinder
  dispute resolution. A complete body of evidence may favor dispute
  resolution, in the sense that it can close off questions and doubts
  that an incomplete body of evidence would instead leave open. In this
  sense, complete evidence favors dispute resolution. On the other hand,
  the signal-to-noise ratio---or what we earlier called the reliability
  of the evidence---in a complete body of evidence could be lower than
  in an body of evidence with gaps. When this occurs, the complete body
  of evidence would be less likely to settle a dispute and may actually
  invite further litigation. \label{footnote:dispute-resolution}} We
will look at examples of when a complete body of evidence may be less
reliable than an incomplete one later on.

Crucially, the answer to the question about the impact of gaps on
accuracy is premised on the assumption that gaps arise for fortuitous
and random processes; they do not follow a systemic pattern. When they
do follow a systemic pattern, gaps in the evidence pose an additional
problem. We now turn to this additional problem.

\hypertarget{random-or-systemic-gaps}{%
\subsection{Random or systemic gaps}\label{random-or-systemic-gaps}}

To underscore the point about random patterns in evidence gaps, it is
instructive to draw a comparison with data collection. The problem of
gaps in the evidence is pervasive and not confined to legal systems of
adjudication. For example, researchers in the social sciences may need
to make inferences from data sets that contain gaps:

\begin{quote}
consider a large survey of families conducted in 1967 with many
socioeconomic variables recorded, and a follow-up survey of the same
families in 1970. Not only is it likely that there will be a few missing
values scattered throughout the data set, but also it is likely that
there will be a large block of missing values in the 1970 data because
many families studied in 1967 could not be located in 1970. (Inference
and Missing Data Author(s): Donald B. Rubin Source: Biometrika, Vol. 63,
No.~3 (Dec., 1976), pp.~581-592)
\end{quote}

In such cases, it is paramount to understand the mechanism that explains
why some data points can go missing. If randomness is the cause, that
some data are missing should raise a minor problem. In the quotation
above, the researcher was attempting to paint an accurate picture of
large scale historical trends in socioeconomic variables for families in
the 60's and 70's. That individual data points are missing at random
should not affect the understanding of these large scale historical
trends. If, instead, the mechanism exhibits a systemic pattern, that
pattern must be taken into account and the inferences drawn from the
data should be corrected. What this correction should be is a difficult
question to answer.

The problem of gaps in the evidence in legal systems of adjudication
shares some of the problem of gaps in data, but is also distinctive. It
is distinctive in that the causes for why evidence goes missing in legal
trials are not the same as the causes why data can go missing (see
earlier discussion of causes of missing evidence). On the other hand,
there is an important parallelism. Data points can be missing because of
random error in observational data. Similarly, legal evidence can be
missing because of fortuitous circumstances that do not follow any
systemic pattern.

But what happens when gaps in the evidence do follow systemic patterns?
The problem of gaps seems more acute when one side or the other has
better access to complete evidence---say for economic reasons---and then
takes advantage of what we might term \textit{informational asymmetry}.
In this sense, symmetric (random) gaps in the evidence are less
worrisome---if at all---than asymmetric (systemic) ones. When gaps in
the evidence follow a systemic pattern, they do have an additional
detrimental effect on accuracy as well as fairness. For suppose wealthy
defendants have better access to additional evidence and use that
evidence whenever it would benefit their case. This will cause a
unilateral reduction of findings of liability against wealthy
defendants: the ability of wealthy defendants to find evidence in their
favor---and possibly destroy evidence against them if necessary---would
benefit them regardless of the facts of the case. The legal system of
adjudication will thus be less likely to distinguish between truly
guilty wealthy defendants and truly innocent wealthy defendants. This
outcome will be detrimental for accuracy, but also for fairness:
decisions about wealthy defendants will be less accurate and the system
will perform differently across poor and wealthy defendants.

So, a tentative conclusion here is that gaps in the evidence are
particularly worrisome when they are informationally asymmetric, and
less so when they occur for fortuitous circumstances even when they
might have a negative effect on accuracy.

\hypertarget{guiding-questions}{%
\subsection{Guiding questions}\label{guiding-questions}}

In light of the above discussion, the final question to ask concerns how
the legal system should respond to gaps in the evidence. What rules (if
any) it should put in place to remedy gaps? We have seen that gaps in
the evidence are not necessarily a bad thing. It is not true, in
general, that they increase the likelihood that a legal decision could
be erroneous. With this in mind, the following critical questions can
guide how to respond to gaps in the evidence:

\begin{itemize}

\item[(Q1)] Compare the body of available evidence (with gaps) and the would-be body of evidence (without gaps). Do we have reasons to believe that the complete body would be more reliable than than the body of available evidence? 

\item[(Q2)] What is the cause that brought about gaps in the evidence? Is it a fortuitous fact or the result of a systemic pattern that advantages one or the other party in the trial? 

\end{itemize}

\noindent These questions help to outline a framework for designing
remedies. Consider the first question. If the answer is no, the missing
evidence should raise no concern. It has no discernible impact on
accuracy. Answering this first question might be quite difficult,
though. For how do we assess what the would-be complete evidence is like
if the missing evidence is not present? In the next section, we will see
that this question can be realistically answered in some cases. In fact,
whether such a question can be realistically answered is itself a good
guiding criterion for responding to missing evidence.

If the answer to the first questions is yes, the missing evidence will
have an impact on accuracy. Then, consider the second critical question.
If the missing evidence is the result of a systemic pattern, this would
make the evidence particularly problematic. Insofar as this pattern can
be corrected and eliminated---by means of appropriate
incentives---suitable remedies for missing evidence should be
formulated. These remedies should aim to compensate the party that is
negatively affected by the missing evidence. But if the missing evidence
is the result of a fortuitous fact---good or bad lack, depending on
which side we look---there cannot much the legal system can do. The
reduced level of accuracy that results from the missing evidence might
be an inevitable cost that any system of adjudication must bear.

These remarks are general, but are not uninformative. They draw a line
between gaps in the evidence the system of adjudication should care
about, and gaps the system should not care about. In what follows, we
will analyze some paradigmatic legal cases that contain gaps in the
evidence. These cases will allow us to become familiar with the legal
framework for dealing with missing evidence. We will then see how the
theoretical framework can inform how the law should handle gaps in the
evidence.

\hypertarget{legal-framework}{%
\section{Legal Framework}\label{legal-framework}}

The legal framework for dealing with missing evidence is informed by a
number of questions. They pertain to the relevance of the missing
evidence, its prejudicial effects, and the remedies that can be applied.
Considerations about why the evidence is missing are also important.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] Relevance - Is the missing evidence relevant?
\item[] Prejudice - Could the missing evidence make a difference to the decision?
\item[] Circumstances - Why is the evidence missing? Was it an accident or misconduct? Did one of the parties have a duty to preserve the missing evidence?
\item[] Remedy - What remedies should be granted to the litigant disadvantaged 
by the missing evidence?
\end{itemize}

\noindent The context here is that one of the two litigants complains,
before or after trial, about missing evidence and asks for a remedy, say
a missing evidence instruction, a sanction against the other party, or
retrial. So the complaining party should make a case that the missing
evidence is relevant and prejudicial, and also that a remedy must be
granted that would be appropriate to the circumstances at hand. These
complaints are often made because one party fails to comply with another
party's request to disclose information, documents and witnesses
relevant to the case.\footnote{See, for example, Rule 37 (Failure to
  Make Disclosures or to Cooperate in Discovery; Sanctions) of Federal
  Rules of Civil Procedures and Rule 16 (Discovery and Inspection) of
  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.}

\hypertarget{relevance-and-prejudice}{%
\subsection{Relevance and prejudice}\label{relevance-and-prejudice}}

At first blush, the first two questions can be understood as forming a
flowchart. If the missing evidence is not relevant, the question of
prejudice does not arise. If the evidence is not prejudicial, the other
questions---especially the question of what remedies should be
granted---does not arise. But this interpretation is overly rigid and
needlessly algorithmic. These questions are better considered
holistically. An understanding of the circumstances that caused the
evidence to be missing will help to discern whether the evidence is
relevant or prejudicial, and thus also select the appropriate remedy. It
is helpful, though, for analytical clarity, to consider the first two
questions separately.

The question of relevance must be understood broadly. Relevance is
traditionally defined as the combination of (a) probative value and (b)
materiality. Rule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence reads:

\begin{quote}
Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.
\end{quote}

\noindent The question of relevance for missing evidence requires a
judgment of \textit{would-be} relevance. Missing evidence is evidence
whose content is generally unknown. It could favor one side or the other
side, say it could be incriminating or exculpatory. If the content of
the missing evidence were known, the evidence would not be missing in
the full sense. So, in order to meet the would-be-relevance test, the
missing evidence---however its content turns out to be exactly---should
strengthen or weaken the case of one of the litigants. More precisely,
the party complaining about missing evidence must demonstrate

\begin{quote}
``a relationship between the requested evidence and the issues in the
case, and there must exist a reasonable indication that the requested
evidence will either lead to other admissible evidence, assist the
defendant in the preparation of witnesses or in corroborating testimony,
or be useful as impeachment or rebuttal evidence.'' United States v.
Curtis , 755 A.2d 1011, 1014--15 (D.C. 2000), cited in Buchanan v.
United States, 165 A.3d 297, 304 (D.C. 2017).
\end{quote}

\noindent And to put the requirement more clearly in terms of altering
the balance of the available evidence:

\begin{quote}
``The defense must show more than that the item bears some abstract
logical relationship to the issues in the case. There must be some
indication that \ldots{} the item would enable the defendant
significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.'' United
States v. Jordan , 316 F.3d 1215, 1251 (11th Cir. 2003).
\end{quote}

\noindent Short of that, any litigation about missing evidence should
not even begin. The bar is high.

It might not always be clear whether the would-be-relevance test is met.
For example, suppose the defendant is charged with illegal possession of
firearm. The police legally searched the defendant's vehicle and found a
firearm. The defendant had no permit. The police searches the rest of
the car and finds a backpack, but does not retain all the items in the
backpack: keys, pieces of paper, trash. The defense complains that the
evidence is incomplete: information about the contents of the backpack
is missing. On one interpretation, the missing evidence seems
irrelevant. The evidence available shows conclusively that the defendant
was carrying a firearm without a permit. The exact content of the
backpack does not make any difference.\footnote{Howard v. United States
  - No.~18-CF-157 District of Columbia Court of Appeals Link to case:
  \url{https://www.dccourts.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/Howard\%20v\%20United\%20States\%2018-CF-157.pdf}}

But the party adversely affected by the missing evidence---the defendant
here---might object. What if an item in the backpack---say, the
keys---could have indicated the backpack was not the defendant's?

\begin{quote}
Counsel for appellant \ldots{} {[}suggested{]} that even if the defense
team had been unable to locate the owner of the key, they could have
tried the key at Howard's dwelling and demonstrated that it was not his.
In other words, even if the defendant could not point the finger at any
particular third party, he could present a theory that the backpack was
shared. (Howard v. United States - No.~18-CF-157 District of Columbia
Court of Appeals, p.~15)
\end{quote}

\noindent So the keys could be exculpatory evidence. If they did not
belong to defendant, the backpack did not either, and neither did the
firearm---or so the defense could argue. Perhaps this argument is
sufficient to alter the balance of evidence and create a reasonable
doubt. In this way, however, any missing piece of information---given a
broad enough interpretation---can pass the would-be relevance test and
potentially alter the balance of the existing evidence.

The response of the court to the defendant's argument is worth citing in
full:

\begin{quote}
``Appellant's argument is based entirely on speculation. It is, of
course, equally plausible that the key was Howard's and that it would
have provided additional evidence of his guilt. And though identifying
the backpack as Howard's was important, the weapon was found underneath
appellant's seat after officers watched him lean forward and then sit
back up when he saw that the car was being pulled over. \ldots{} the
exculpatory value of the key was wholly speculative \ldots{} there was
additional evidence outside of the backpack linking the gun to Howard,
and \ldots{} other evidence indicated that the backpack and its contents
were indeed his'' (ibid, p.~17)
\end{quote}

\noindent How should we interpret the court's reasoning? Perhaps, we
need not split hair about the would-be-relevance test. Granted, the
keys---under a plausible interpretation---could be relevant exculpatory
evidence. But what matters is whether the missing (relevant) evidence
could make a difference for the decision, in light of all other evidence
available. If it cannot---even interpreted in the light most favorable
to one of the parties---the question whether we should worry about the
missing evidence is moot. In other words, the question of relevance
becomes moot \emph{absent prejudice}. So the first two questions of
relevance and prejudice boil down to the question of prejudice: whether
the missing evidence could tilt the scale in favor of the defendant so
significantly that the verdict would turn around.

\hypertarget{circumstances-and-remedies}{%
\subsection{Circumstances and
remedies}\label{circumstances-and-remedies}}

Let's tackle the question of remedies. This question offers great
latitude. An extreme remedy would be this: if there is missing relevant
and prejudicial evidence that goes to the detriment of the accused
party, the case should not be decided and the accusation dismissed. This
remedy is excessive: it will create a perverse incentive for defendants
to destroy evidence in their favor. The absence of any relevant evidence
that could be prejudicial for them---in this case, evidence in favor of
the defendant---would be enough to dismiss the accusation. Instead of
presenting exculpatory evidence to be tested via cross-examination,
defendants would prefer to destroy it. They would then argue they were
prejudiced and should win the case. This arrangement makes little sense.
Alternatively, such a remedy could apply only provided the party
bringing the accusation was responsible for destroying the evidence
favoring the defendant.

Remedies can apply at the level of how the evidence is assessed, not
directly to decisions. So, for example, the remedy could be this: the
party responsible for the missing evidence and that attempted to benefit
from this fact should have their case weakened by a quantum of
evidential force proportionate to the extent to which the party sought
to benefit by causing the gap. There are other possible formulations,
for example, an adverse jury instruction to presume a fact obtained,
where the presumed fact weakens the case of the party that, in bad
faith, contributed to the destruction of the evidence.

Another approach would be to initiate a separate litigation for missing
evidence. This might be more appropriate in criminal then civil cases.
To penalize criminal defendants with adverse jury instructions because
they destroyed evidence may clash with other well-established rights
defendants have, such as the right to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty. At the same time, destruction of incriminating evidence must be
negatively sanctioned. To this end, destruction or tainting of evidence
relevant for criminal litigation can count as a wrongdoing in itself
which can be litigated in a separate trial. This should provide the
right incentive for people not to destroy evidence.

This survey of possibilities is not exhaustive. To get a sense for the
broader array of remedies available, here is an excerpt from N.Y. Crim.
Proc. Law § 245.80, 2 (Available remedies or sanctions):

\begin{quote}
For failure to comply with any discovery order imposed or issued
pursuant to this article, the court may make a further order for
discovery, grant a continuance, order that a hearing be reopened, order
that a witness be called or recalled, instruct the jury that it may draw
an adverse inference regarding the non-compliance, preclude or strike a
witness's testimony or a portion of a witness's testimony, admit or
exclude evidence, order a mistrial, order the dismissal of all or some
of the charges provided that, after considering all other remedies,
dismissal is appropriate and proportionate to the prejudice suffered by
the party entitled to disclosure, or make such other order as it deems
just under the circumstances; except that any sanction against the
defendant shall comport with the defendant's constitutional right to
present a defense, and precluding a defense witness from testifying
shall be permissible only upon a finding that the defendant's failure to
comply with the discovery obligation or order was willful and motivated
by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{bad-faith-and-adverse-jury-instruction}{%
\subsection{Bad faith and adverse jury
instruction}\label{bad-faith-and-adverse-jury-instruction}}

Given the wide range of possibilities, it is helpful to focus on a
specific version of remedies that is quite paradigmatic: an adverse jury
instruction against a party granted because of the party's bad faith.
Often, if one of the parties destroyed evidence in bad faith, an adverse
jury instruction is warranted against that party---say, presuming that
the missing evidence was in fact unfavorable to that party.

Consider a more elaborate version of the trip and fall case at the start
of this paper.\footnote{Details of the case are as follows: Decker v.
  Target Corp, Case No.~1:16-cv-00171-JNP-BCW, Filed 10/10/2018} An
accident occurs at Target, a chain of department stores in the United
States. The customer slips, falls and gets injured in a Target store
because of a flatbed, possibly left unattended. The customer suffers
serious injury and is transported to a hospital. The customer sues
Target and seeks to recover damages. However, video surveillance footage
is only preserved in part. The rest is destroyed. It is impossible to
reconstruct what happened before the incident.\footnote{The incident
  occurred on December 26, 2015, at the Target store located in
  Riverdale, Utah: ``Caryl Jean Decker was shopping when she tripped on
  a flatbed stocking cart and fell onto the floor, suffering serious
  injury. Mrs.~Decker, bleeding from the head, received medical
  attention at the scene of the incident. She was transported from
  Target by ambulance.'' The incident was recorded in its entirety by
  Target's surveillance camera. However, only a short portion of the
  video was preserved, just a few seconds depicting the fall. The
  portions of the video before and after the incident was erased.}
Before trial, the plaintiff---the customer bringing forth the
accusation---seeks an adverse inference jury instruction against Target
for failing to preserve the video. The Court agrees and instructs the
jury they can presume that the cart had been left unattended.\footnote{The
  outcome of the jury trial, however, favors Target, not the customer:
  ``Case Number: 1:16-cv-00171-JNP. Outcome: JUDGMENT - This action came
  before the court for a trial by jury. The issues have been tried and
  the jury has rendered its verdict. IT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that
  judgment is entered in favor of defendant Target Corporation and
  against plaintiffs Caryl Jean and Dennis Decker. Case Closed.
  Magistrate Judge Brooke C. Wells no longer assigned to case. Signed by
  Judge Jill N. Parrish on 10/22/2018. (jds) (Entered: 10/22/2018)''
  \url{https://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?n=1:16-cv-00171-JNP\&s=UT\&d=121221}}

To arrive at this conclusion, the Court established three points. First,
it established that Target had a duty to preserve the video
footage.\footnote{This is the legal doctrine followed in the case:
  ``Spoliation sanctions are proper when `(1) a party has a duty to
  preserve evidence because it knew, or should have known, that
  litigation was imminent, and (2) the adverse party was prejudiced by
  the destruction of the evidence.'\,'' Turner, 563 F.3d at 1149
  (quoting Burlington Northern \& Santa Fe Ry. Co.~v. Grant , 505 F.3d
  1013, 1032 (10th Cir. 2007)). For one thing, plaintiff made a prompt
  and explicit request to preserve all relevant portions of the
  recording one month after the incident. (``Exactly one month after the
  incident, on January 26, 2016, the Deckers delivered a letter to
  Target, through counsel, requesting that Target preserve ``all
  pertinent records and electronic records pertaining to {[}the{]}
  incident or that could relate to {[}the{]} incident,'' as well as ``a
  copy of any video surveillance that shows {[}the{]} accident or the
  area of the accident at any time before, during, or after the event.''
  Motion for Findings of Spoliation and for Sanctions (``Motion'')
  Exhibit 6.'') On the other hand, Target's policy was to preserve
  recordings for no more than twenty-five days. (``The unsaved portions
  of the footage were later automatically overwritten by Target's
  system, which only maintains video surveillance footage for
  approximately fifteen to twenty-five days.'') Target could argue---as
  it did---that it followed its policy. But the question, as the Court
  noted, was whether Target had a duty to preserve a more extended
  version of the recording. The Court reasoned that Target knew---or
  should have known---that litigation was imminent: ``In this case, it
  is apparent that Target was on notice that litigation was imminent
  when Mrs.~Decker tripped, fell, and left the Target store in an
  ambulance on December 26, 2015. Target argues it was not on notice
  until the Deckers' demand letter arrived on January 26, 2016; however,
  that argument is disingenuous. Mrs.~Decker fell and an ambulance was
  called. This was a ``guest incident'' of the sort that Target's
  internal policies note create the ``potential for a general liability
  claim to be brought against Target.'' So, even though Target's general
  policy is to delete videos after twenty-five days, this policy is
  overwritten in special circumstances, for example, when litigation is
  imminent. In deleting the relevant portions of the video, Target's
  violated its own policy pertaining to imminent litigation. All in all,
  then, Target should have preserved the video it deleted.} Second, it
established that the missing video was prejudicial against the
plaintiff. They could not make their case, since there was hardly any
other source of information about what happened around the cart:

\begin{quote}
Due to this deletion, the Deckers do not know who placed the flatbed stocking cart at the location of the incident, how long it was there, or why it was there. The Deckers are not prejudiced by the lack of evidence of who placed the flatbed cart because Target does not contest that it was placed on the floor by one of Target’s own employees. However, the Deckers are prejudiced by the lack of footage that would have documented  whether or not the cart was being “worked” or “attended” by a Target employee.
\end{quote}

\noindent  These two points, however, are not enough to warrant an
adverse jury instruction against Target. The adverse instruction is
justified provided there was bad faith on part of Target.\footnote{``To
  be entitled to an adverse inference instruction, the Deckers must
  establish that Target acted in bad faith in failing to preserve the
  evidence at issue.''}

Did Target act in bad faith in deleting the relevant portions of the
video? The issue here is muddled, but the basic rationale the Court
followed is this. Target went against its own policy and deleted
relevant video recordings that its own policy would mandate to preserve.
In addition, Target tried to argue that the flatbed was attended by an
employee (which is an issue that cannot be litigated since the relevant
recording was destroyed). More specifically, the Court wrote:

\begin{quote}
In the footage that remains, there is no evidence of a Target employee working the flatbed cart, nor does the flatbed cart appear to move in the eleven-minute gap between the two clips. A reasonable juror could infer that the cart was unattended. However, in defending against the Deckers’ claims, Target intends to offer evidence that one or more Target employees were working or attending the cart ... the Deckers ... have no way to disprove that evidence."
\end{quote}

\noindent Both considerations---one: Target's violation of its policy;
two: Target's attempt to take advantage of the missing evidence that it
itself caused---suggest bad faith on the part of Target as a
corporation.\footnote{There was no bad faith on the part of the
  individual who deleted the video. The employees who deleted the video
  claim they were not aware of Target's policy pertaining to imminent
  litigation. More specifically, this is the reasoning of the Court more
  in detail: ``First, Target failed to instruct its employees regarding
  Target policy of what footage to preserve. Second, Target employees
  failed to preserve all relevant footage. And third, Target's counsel
  now seeks to take advantage of the evidence that Target failed to
  preserve by arguing that the flatbed cart was attended or worked by
  Target employees during the gap in the video. It is this attempt to
  take advantage of a situation that Target caused that leads the court
  to conclude Target acted in bad faith.''} So the Court granted the
adverse inference jury instruction.\footnote{ Specifically: ``The court
  will therefore instruct the jury to make the adverse inference that
  the flatbed cart was unattended for the twenty minutes prior to the
  accident.''}

\vspace{4mm}

\noindent Let us take stock. As we have analyzed it, the legal framework
for handling missing evidence is a two-tier system: first, ask about the
prejudicial effects of the missing evidence; next, examine the
circumstances (such as bad faith) that caused the evidence to be missing
and devise an appropriate remedy (such as adverse jury instruction).
There is tremendous complexity inherent in this framework, but this
sketch captures some of the essential elements. The theoretical
framework bears some resemblance to the legal framework but is also
different. The two guiding questions are: (Q1) would the missing
evidence have improved accuracy? (Q2) was the evidence missing because
of fortuitous causes?

In what follows, we will examine the connections between the theoretical
framework and legal framework. We will use one to illuminate the other,
and identify a few complications.

\hypertarget{prejudice-or-reliability}{%
\section{Prejudice or reliability?}\label{prejudice-or-reliability}}

One might worry that the legal framework gives undue importance to the
question of prejudice, namely the extent to which the addition of the
missing evidence may turn the verdict around. We will see that the
question of prejudice need not be the key question to ask in cases of
missing evidence. The question of reliability should take precedence. We
will also see that this conclusion agrees with legal practice.

\hypertarget{unknonw-probative-value}{%
\subsection{Unknonw probative value}\label{unknonw-probative-value}}

Even if the missing evidence is prejudicial---it can reasonably make a
difference to the decision and turn the verdict around---its addition
could lower the accuracy of the decision-making process. Recall the
simple model from before. There, we imagined a case in which (a) the
missing evidence had a lower level of reliability about the facts than
the already available evidence and (b) the missing evidence, if added,
would have decided the case---it would have been the one piece of
evidence that made a difference. When both (a) and (b) are met,
additional evidence could actually lower accuracy. So, the question of
prejudice should be supplemented---or even replaced---by another
question, along the lines of question (Q1) in the theoretical framework:
do we have reasons to believe that the expanded body of evidence would
be more reliable than the body of available evidence with gaps? If the
answer to this question is negative, the fact that evidence is missing
should be given little or no weight. Even if its absence has a
prejudicial effect against one of the parties---say the defendant---we
have no reason to believe that its addition would have brought about a
more reliable decision-making process.

Unfortunately, assigning a decisive role to the question of
reliability---over and above the question of prejudice---risks creating
an unnecessary tension between the two rationales:

\begin{itemize}

\item[] \textbf{Reliability First:} If the missing evidence, once added to the existing body of evidence, would have lowered the accuracy of the decision---say because the missing evidence is, in an objective sense, misleading or with lower reliability---it should be disregarded. So, in cases of missing evidence, the question of reliability is primary. In procedural terms, the rule should be: absent any clear reason for thinking the missing evidence would enhance accuracy, the missing evidence should be disregarded; if there is a clear reason for thinking the missing evidence would enhance accuracy, the missing evidence should be taken into account.

\item[] \textbf{Prejudice First:} A defendant may benefit from evidence even if it is misleading evidence so long as the evidence, assessed on its face, appears to favor the defendant and is able to tip overall balance of evidence in their favor. This should apply to all defendants. So, in cases of missing evidence, the question of prejudice is primary. In procedural terms, the rule should be: absent any clear reason for thinking the missing evidence would turn the verdict around (prejudice), the missing evidence should be disregarded; if there is a clear reason for thinking the missing evidence would turn the verdict around, the missing evidence should be taken into account.
\end{itemize}

\noindent But Prejudice First may be too extreme position even in light
of legal practice. Making trial decisions guided by evidence whose
content in unknown raises the danger of deciding on non-evidence. This
runs counter to evidence-based trial decision-making:

\begin{quote}
A primary function of jury instructions, as well as the rules of
procedure and evidence, is to confine the jury's attention to firsthand
testimony from those with personal knowledge of relevant facts, which
may be probed on cross-examination, thereby excluding conjecture. The
missing witness inference represents a radical departure from this
paradigm, for it essentially creates evidence from non-evidence. The
risk is always present that the jury will give undue weight to the
presumed content of testimony not presented, and insufficient weight to
that which was presented. Thomas v. United States, 447 A.2d 52, 58 (D.C.
1982).
\end{quote}

\noindent Even if we knew precisely the content of the missing evidence,
this content could not be tested in the traditional manner, say via
cross-examination. This adversarial procedure is helpful to understand
how strong a testimony is and thus assign weight appropriately together
with the other evidence in the case. The danger of relying on missing
evidence is to exaggerate its probative value.

The upshot is this. If the probative value of the missing evidence can
only be inferred via a tenuous conjecture---so the evidence could have
strong as well as rather weak probative value---and if its addition
could in principle lower the accuracy of the decision-making process,
this is a good reason to block any further discussion about the missing
evidence. Only if the missing evidence would have clearly enhanced the
accuracy of the decision-making process---and in order to do that, the
missing evidence should ensure that overall evidence has a stronger
probative value than the existing (gappy) evidence---can a discussion
begin about possible remedies. If this is right, questions of relevance
and prejudice are moot unless the accuracy-enhancing role of the missing
evidence is made clear.

The case law in the United States we have looked at is never quite
explicit on this point. But litigation about missing evidence is often
confined to cases that satisfy rather stringent conditions: first, it is
clearly know that evidence is missing; second, how the missing evidence
could contribute to finding the facts is also known; and third, adding
the missing evidence would make the decision-making process clearly more
accurate. When these conditions are not met---as in the illegal firearm
case---courts are quite skeptical about considering missing evidence.
When these conditions are met---as in the Target case---courts are
willing to consider what remedies should be granted to the party
negatively affected by the missing evidence. So, even though the case
law never explicitly discusses question (Q1) on the effects of missing
evidence on accuracy, this question might very well implicitly guide the
stringent conditions that courts---and litigants themselves---apply to
questions of missing evidence.

\hypertarget{conjectural-gaps}{%
\subsection{Conjectural gaps}\label{conjectural-gaps}}

As already noted, a feature of litigation about missing evidence is that
the missing evidence must be known to be missing, in a rather precise
and detailed manner. The litigants agree on a well-specified story or
series of facts which unequivocally establish that pieces of information
have gone missing: a witness present was not interrogated; a video
recording was not preserved; a document was destroyed; etc. So the
events relating to the missing evidence are well-documented and
uncontested. In addition, it is clear that the missing evidence would
have enhanced the accuracy of the fact-finding process. Recall the
Target case. The missing video recording is the only evidence that could
bear on what happened before and after the trip and fall incident. It
could provide information with a high level of reliability.

The case law, then, usually considers cases when we know evidence is
missing. We know something happened and we know evidence went missing.
There is a clear story about the evidence missing. Since the missing
evidence fits a clear story, there is good reason to assume that, if
that evidence were added, the decision would be overall of a better
quality---say, the false positive and false negative rates would
diminish. These are cases considered in the legal framework.

But evidence may be missing in circumstances that are less clear-cut.
What if evidence is missing in a more generic, conjectural sense? A
couple of examples can be helpful to fix ideas.

First, a series of events that are agreed upon by the litigants may
reasonably suggest that a certain type of evidence should be presented
in litigation, but actually it is not. In a murder case involving
material traces, one would reasonably expect to hear genetic match
evidence in the case; in a case about driving while intoxicated, one
would reasonably expect the prosecution to present evidence of a
breathalyzer reading besides the testimony of the officer; and so on.
These reasonably expectations are of course historically dependent. One
could not reasonably expect to see genetic evidence in a criminal case
in the 1950's.

Second, evidence can go missing in an even less specifics manner. Say
there is genetic evidence about the defendant: the traces at the crime
scene match the defendant. Yet this match evidence is unaccompanied by
error rates of the lab that performed the analysis. Lab error rates help
to assess the credibility of match evidence, but their absence cannot be
ascribed to a specific series of events nor does it fall short to what
one would reasonably expect to see as evidence. Another example would
be: evidence is missing about the reliability of an eyewitness. In a
sense, the type of missing evidence here is higher-order evidence: it is
evidence about the reliability of first-order evidence

What to say about these conjectural cases of missing evidence? Here, it
is less clear how to answer the question of prejudice and reliability.
In fact, these questions need not be answered right away. In these
cases, it is perhaps best to examine first why these pieces of
information are missing. If there is no clearly specified causal chain
that explains why the evidence in question is missing, then no party can
be held accountable for the missing evidence. It would just be a
fortuitous accident. This brings us to our next topic: how the
circumstances that explain why evidence is missing should inform the
formulation of the remedies.

\hypertarget{epistemology-or-policy}{%
\section{Epistemology or policy?}\label{epistemology-or-policy}}

It is clear that remedies about missing evidence---whatever their exact
articulation---cannot be decided without answering the question of why
the evidence in question had gone missing. It would seem odd---or
perhaps even immoral---to penalize a party that would otherwise benefit
from the fact that some evidence is missing even though the party had no
responsibility in bringing about the fact of missing evidence. To this
end, it is useful to distinguish three paradigmatic cases: bad faith
intent; negligence; pure accidents.

\hypertarget{bad-faith}{%
\subsection{Bad faith}\label{bad-faith}}

The question of bad faith intent is often crucial in formulating the
appropriate remedy. A remedy for missing evidence could go along these
lines: if available evidence cannot settle a factual dispute between
litigants and a litigant destructed relevant evidence with bad faith
intent of benefiting from the destruction, the dispute should be
resolved against the litigant; if, however, the lack of evidence tips
the scale in favor of a litigant who however did not maliciously act to
destroy the evidence, the issue must be resolved in favor of that
litigant in accordance to the balance of the available evidence. What
would justify this rule?

The rule just proposed could be justified on the basis of a policy
objective: it would create the right forward-looking incentives for
litigants not to destroy evidence with the intent of benefiting from the
destruction. But such remedy to gaps in the evidence may have a more
straightforward epistemic goal, internal to the logic of evidence
evaluation. Why should the litigant who destroyed the evidence with bad
faith intent be penalized? The following inference is plausible: the
missing evidence that was destroyed would be in favor or against the
litigant. It is unlikely that a litigant would destroy evidence in their
favor, and thus the evidence must have been unfavorable to them. If the
evidence was unfavorable to them and had the evidence not been
destroyed, the balance of the evidence would have tipped against the
defendant. Hence, the dispute must be resolved against the litigant who
destroyed the evidence. This analysis does not justify the remedy to
gaps based on any specific policy objectives. In fact, this analysis
simply aims to assess the evidence conscientiously and draws inference
about missing evidence---its treats missing evidence as another fact
that can be used as information to draw inference about the disputed
facts.

One approach sees the remedy in terms of conscientiousness assessment of
the evidence: that some evidence is missing becomes itself information
(evidence) that helps to draw inferences together with other evidence.
This an epistemic approach, internal to the logic of evidence
evaluation. The other approach views gaps in the evidence as a a result
of objectionable out-of-court behavior that must be sanctioned. Call
this the policy approach. The two approaches are not exclusive, but one
question is whether the epistemic approach can cover all cases or the
policy approach is needed.

\hypertarget{negligence}{%
\subsection{Negligence}\label{negligence}}

The epistemic approach is limited to cases of evidence missing because
of bad faith intent. For suppose that, without any bad faith intent, the
evidence is missing because of someone's negligence or failure to comply
with certain standards. In these circumstances, the inference that the
missing evidence must speak against the party that would benefit from
the missing evidence cannot be drawn. Here is an even more
straightforward case: a video recording is missing because of an
accidental blackout or a glib in the system (more on such cases soon).
So, in these circumstances, the epistemic approach would recommend no
remedy. Is this the right outcome? Since there is no obviously culpable
behavior responsible for the missing evidence, maybe the answer is just:
do nothing.

The policy approach, on the other hand, could still recommend a
remedy---say, that the party that would otherwise benefit from the
missing evidence should be penalized even if the evidence is missing
because of non-culpable behavior. The remedy could be to rule in favor
of the customer to create an incentive for shop-owners to preserve
videos recording for longer period of time.

The difference between epistemic and policy approach is brought to light
by considering a case recently discussed by Christian Dahlman. A man
voluntarily confesses to having stabbed an elderly woman while
attempting to stole money from her apartment. The man gives a detailed
story about the incident. The man is incriminated and tried for murder.
The material evidence mostly fits the defendant's confession. But there
are some loose ends: the angle of stabbing is odd for a short men such
as the defendant, and in addition, the defendant has no criminal records
and no clear reason to rob the elderly woman. The defense argues that
the defendant's confession is unreliable: it is an attempt to cover for
others. The defendant has two sons, both taller than him, both with a
criminal record. Unfortunately, since the defendant confessed, the
police did not think it was necessary analyze the tin box that contained
the money for fingerprints or genetic material. The box was later wiped
clean. Forensic analyses of the tin box could have verified or falsified
the defendant's confession. Absent that, the available evidence rests
almost entirely on the confession.

The balance of the available evidence tips against the defendant, but
there are reasons to doubt the reliability of the confession. The fact
that forensic analyses about the tin box are missing cannot be used to
make an inference that they must have been exculpatory. So the epistemic
approach would recommend no remedy here. But even though there was no
bad faith intent here, there was negligence---or at least lack of
rigor---on the part of the police. The policy approach, then, could
recommend that the case be resolved in favor of the defendant. This
remedy would give an incentives to police officers to conduct more
through investigations going forward.

The general question is, what are these policy-driven remedies intended
to achieve? In the case of the epistemic remedies the goal is
clear---evaluate the evidence carefully---but when policy remedies are
introduced, what is their goal? To answer this question, it is useful to
to look at a third paradigmatic cases of missing evidence: purely
accidental cases.

\hypertarget{pure-accidents}{%
\subsection{Pure accidents}\label{pure-accidents}}

Imagine a cases in which (a) the missing evidence does not warrant any
inference against the party that would otherwise benefit from the
missing evidence and (b) a remedy against the party that would otherwise
benefit from the missing evidence does not create any incentives. The
second condition holds because the evidence is missing for purely
accidental reasons that are beyond control of either party. There is no
causal chain---whether through bad faith intent or negligence---in which
one of the party is implicated in bringing about the fact of missing
evidence. Since there is no such causal chain, no remedy that would
adversely affect one of the parties would have any effect on their
future behavior about the collection, presentation or presentation of
evidence. Any such remedy may have an effect on behavior but no one that
would be relevant for missing evidence.

So the ultimate question in designing remedies seem to be question (Q2)
from the theoretical framework: What is the cause that brought about
gaps in the evidence? Is it a fortuitous fact or the result of a
systemic pattern that advantages one or the other party in the trial? If
a pure accident is that reason why the evidence is missing, then no
remedy would seem appropriate, simply because whatever the remedy it
would not affect the future availability of the evidence in a
predictable manner.

Focusing in question (2) however still laves open the question about the
goals and objectives of remedies for missing evidence. One approach goes
back to question (Q1): Compare the body of available evidence (with
gaps) and the would-be body of evidence (without gaps). Do we have
reasons to believe that the complete body would be more reliable than
than the body of available evidence? So remedies for missing
evidence---so long as they have affect on the availability of evidence
going forward---should be geared towards ensuring that the more complete
body of evidence is overall more reliable than a gappy one. A fuller
discussion of this point is the topic of the next section.

\hypertarget{tentative-general-theory}{%
\section{Tentative general theory}\label{tentative-general-theory}}

Our proposed general theory about addressing cases of missing evidence
rests of a number of considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Prejudice or reliability. Ask whether the missing evidence could be prejudicial (legal sense) or more generally whether it would bring about a more reliable decision making system. There need not be disagreement with legal framework, which focuses on clearly prejudicial forms of missing evidence--evidence that should have a substantive impact on the balance, not just a slightly, unclear, conjectural impact.

\item[(2)] Draw on as many epistemic resources to assess the epistemic impact of missing evidence---e.g. bad faith suggests that missing evidence would disfavors
one party, use also Rafal's weight or Bayesian network. Use also Kaye's suggestion of using the fact of missing evidence as itself an item of evidence. Jury instruction sometimes follow this scheme. See Hamer's poinbt below and criticism.

\item[(3)] Go beyond epistemology to create right incentives, but need not go too much beyond epistemology if goal is to increase accuracy in the long-run. So remedies could create incentive to preserve evidence that, if presented, would improve accuracy of adjudication.

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hamers-argument}{%
\subsection{Hamer's argument}\label{hamers-argument}}

\textbf{Hamer's first claim:} New evidence can turn out to be positive
(say incriminating) or negative (exculpatory). Since one cannot know
that in advance, the expected probability based on this added evidence
(which can be positive or negative) is just the probability based on the
current evidence. He proves this claim analytically in the appendix to
his paper.

\begin{quote}
More generally, if the evidence is missing it cannot be known which way it points.
It appears equally possible that the missing evidence would confirm the current factual conclusion as
contradict it. The competing possibilities cancel each other out. There is no warrant for the assumption
that the missing evidence will point one way rather than the other. (p. 139)
\end{quote}

\textbf{Comment:} This claim seems right, but there is one puzzling
thing. In our paper on unanticipated possibilities and Bayesian
networks, we show that---given a certain causal structure of the
Bayesian network (=collider with two upstream nodes incoming into
downstream evidence hypothesis, the added node is upstream)---merely
positing that there could be new information (say we could learn the
witness was unreliable or reliable) would change the initial probability
assessment (without learning about the value of the evidence). This is
not true in other cases in which the Bayesian network has a serial
structure and the added node is downstream and not upstream. So, while
Hamer is right in the most abstract sense, there might be causal
structural features of a case (as captured by a Bayesian network) that
do warrant changing one's probability assessment in virtue of learning
that that could be other evidence (even though you do not know what that
evidence actually is).
