\section{Structure of paper}\label{structure-of-paper}}

First talk about some paradigmatic legal cases and established legal
framework to handle cases of missing evidence.

One: Salem trials. Here the content of the missing is know, so is it
really a case of missing evidence?

Two: Target case. Here tha there is missing evidence is clear (vida was
erased), but te question of the conten of the video is open.

Three: could there be other cases in which whether the evidence is
missing or not might depend on what kind of partisan story one
subscribes to? Or perhaps there might be conflicting stories about why
the evidence is missing.

Note that the legal framework only addresses cases of manifest missing
evidence --- cases in which (a) we know evidence is missing and (b) we
know why it is missing (e.g.~bad faith, negligence, etc.), so we need to
decide what to do with the information (a) and (b), (e.g.~draw an
adverse inference).

Two limitations of the legal framework: (1) if there is no bad faith
intent, then there is no adverse inference to be drawn; (2) given a
settled story about what happened, the story itself tells us some
evidence is missing. But could there other cases of missing
evidence---say more conjectural?

Beyond (1). Consider the case there is no bad faith intent, but the
evidence is still missing. What kind of remedy could address the gap in
this case? Humer's argument is that since the missing evidence could
point in both directions---guilt and innocence---the evidential value
should be dismissed. Missing evidence averages out and thus return the
same probability of guilt as the original evidence. This argument does
not seem correct. So challenge it.

Beyond (2). The even more difficult question is what to do when there is
story that clearly tells us that the evidence is missing, or it is not
clear that the evidence is missing. Here is the difference between the
express ``gaps'' and ``missing evidence'' start to matter. For example,
do you have a gap in the evidence if you have not considered evidence
about how reliable an eyewitness is? Yes and no. This aspects suggests
that evidence is open-ended and thus the problem gaps is less pressing.

\item
  Start with Target case which seems to contain a lot of complexity and
  overview of main topics, then examine legal approach.
\item
  Difference between gaps in a clearly defined story and generic gaps in
  the evidence. The former, when filled, would clearly make the decision
  making more accurate, while the latter could make it less accurate. So
  we need not obsess about gaps in general, but only gaps that are
  clearly articulated. Sp, a decision procedure with more evidence
  (filling clear gaps) is more accurate, but a decision procedure worth
  more evidence (not filling clear gaps) need not be more accurate. So
  conjectural gaps might be less important thazn clear narrative gaps.
\item
  Consider now only clearly specified gaps that are accuracy enhancing.
  Such gaps in evidence may be random/fortuitous or follow a systematic
  pattern. They only worrisome if they follow a systematic pattern. If
  they are random, they will reduce accuracy (because of 1), but not
  favor one side or the other systemically. So sucvh cases might not
  need any regulatations.
\item
  Two rationales for remedies: epistemic individual specific and policy
  rationale. First, if evidence was intentionally removed, it is likely
  it would favopr the other party, etc. here an inference about what the
  missing/removed evidence was likely is made. No appeal to policy.
  Instead, we can also device a policy that says: sanction behavior that
  destroyed evidence when it is in bad faith. The two approaches might
  converge byt might also diverge sometimes. Example: evidence
  destruction was by accident, but there was duty for the defendant to
  preserve evidence. So, epistemic individual approach would not draw
  any adverse inference, but the policy approach would.
\item
  Consider cases of missing stats about reliability of lab genetic
  testing or information about visibility conditions for eyewitness. Is
  this a clearly defined gap in the evidence or a generic gap?

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This much is uncontroversial about trial decision-making: disputes about
matters of fact should be adjudicated in light of the evidence presented
by the litigants. When the answer to a question of fact is disputed, the
litigants are expected to present evidence that supports their version
of the facts. Whoever presents evidence strong enough to meet their
burden of proof should prevail.

A stylized example can make this point vivid. In a civil trial, the
plaintiff sues a shop owner because of an injury that occurred in the
shop. The floor was slippery. The plaintiff tripped and fell. They had a
concussion whose symptoms lasted for more than a month. They seek
compensation for damages. This is the plaintiff's version of the facts.
The defendant, the shop owner, responds that the floor was not slippery.
The defendant did fall and had a concussion---that much is
undisputed---but not because of the slippery floor. Plaintiff and
defendant are disagreeing about a question of fact. What did cause the
plaintiff to trip and fall? What happen, exactly, when the plaintiff
tripped and fell? Evidence must be presented by the litigants to resolve
the dispute. And since this is a civil trial, the decision rule, at
least in some countries such as the United States, is that the party
able to offer the stronger evidence prevails. If the evidence is in
equipoise, the defendant prevails. In other countries, the decision rule
may be different, for example, the party bringing forth the the
accusation---the plaintiff---prevails provided the decision-maker is
convinced by the evidence presented that the plaintiff's story is true.

Despite differences in details about the decision rule, the need to
weigh evidence before reaching a decision should be uncontroversial. But
there is a complication. Suppose the shop had cameras inside. When the
plaintiff tripped and fell, the camera recorded what happened. The
recording, if accessible, could unequivocally tell what happened.
Suppose this is a settled fact. However, for some reason, the camera
recording of that specific incident had gone missing. There isn't much
other evidence that could be gathered, except conflicting testimonies by
the plaintiff and defendant. That day at that time no one else was in
the shop. So, based on the available evidence, the plaintiff would have
a weak case. The available evidence that supports the plaintiff's case
is not any stronger than the evidence that supports the defendant's
case. Merely based on the evidence presented, the plaintiff should lose
the lawsuit.

But this outcome would be, in some important way, unsatisfactory. Why
was the recording missing? The shop owner might have deleted it. Perhpas
they knew they would get in trouble should the customer sue them. If so,
should the case be resolved in favor of the plaintiff even though the
available evidence does not tip in their favor? Perhaps so. Things might
change if it turned out that---by accident---the recording was deleted.
Without settling how the case should be decided right now, the upshot of
this discussion is clear. For one thing, the evidence presented by the
parties should guide trial decisions about matters of fact; there is no
doubt about that. But, in some circumstances, the fact that some
evidence was \textit{not} presented should also guide the decision. To
examine more closely what these circumstances might be---and their
significance for trial decisions---is the task of this paper. We call
this the problem of gaps in the evidence or the problem of missing
evidence.

Legal systems of adjudication contain rules for handling gaps in the
evidence. These rules are elaborate, subtle, intricate. We are not
cataloging these rules, nor offering a comparative study of how
different systems of adjudication address the problem of gaps. Our aim
here is modest---that is, to map out the conceptual terrain. We will
examine a few paradigmatic examples of gaps in the evidence. We will
then sketch guidelines for building a taxonomy of gaps. Finally, we will
discuss how epistemic and non-epistemic considerations can guide the
identification of gaps in the evidence as well as how decision-makers
should respond to them.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Missing evidence in general and when it happens at random need not
  hamper accuracy or dispute resolution.
\item
  Two assumptions: (a) missing evidence happens at random (no patterned
  advantage) and (b) it could be of higher or lower quality compared to
  existing body of evidence.
\item
  Legal system cares about cases of missing evidence that are neither
  (a) nor (b). That is, it cares about cases in which missing evidence
  does not happen at random and cares about cases in which missing
  evidence would have clearly enhanced accuracy.
\end{enumerate}

The problem of gaps in the evidence is pervasive and not confined to
legal systems of adjudication. For example, researchers in the social
sciences may need to make inferences from datasets that contain gaps:

\begin{quote}
consider a large survey of families conducted in 1967 with many
socioeconomic variables recorded, and a follow-up survey of the same
families in 1970. Not only is it likely that there will be a few missing
values scattered throughout the data set, but also it is likely that
there will be a large block of missing values in the 1970 data because
many families studied in 1967 could not be located in 1970. (Inference
and Missing Data Author(s): Donald B. Rubin Source: Biometrika, Vol. 63,
No.~3 (Dec., 1976), pp.~581-592)
\end{quote}

In such cases, it is paramount to understand the mechanism that explains
why some data points can go missing. If randomness is the cause, that
some data are missing should raise a minor problem. If, instead, the
mechanism exhibits a systemic pattern, that pattern must be taken into
account and the inferences drawn from the data should be corrected. What
this correction should be is a difficult question to answer. On the
other hand, if random error is the explanation why some data points are
missing,no correction is need. In the quotation above, the researcher
was attempting to paint an accurate picture of large scale historical
trends in socioeconomic variables for families in the 60's and 70's.
That individual data points are missing at random should not affect the
understanding of these large scale historical trends.

The problem of gaps in the evidence in legal systems of adjudication
shares some of the problem of gaps in data, but is also distinctive. The
first point to address is why the problem of gaps arises for legal
systems of adjudication. Second, we should try to understand what would
be the analog in the legal system of data points that are missing
because of random error in observational, large scale data.

To begin with, imagine systems of adjudication that are immune from the
problem of gaps in the evidence. More specifically, consider a system
that is both complete and infallible---that is, it has access to
evidence about every possible fact at any time in any place and this
evidence is infallible. The problem of gaps does not arise. Crucially,
it is not the infallibility of the system that eliminates the problem of
gaps. For a legal system that was fallible could still be plagued by the
problem of gaps. Think of a system that is complete yet fallible. That
is, it has access to evidence about every possible fact at any time in
any place, yet the evidence could be erroneous. Say, every action by any
individual at any time in any place is recorded, and the recording is
accessible by the legal system. This is completeness. But suppose that
recordings could sometime be erroneous, say because the pixels can get
messed up and depict people doing what they were not doing and fail to
depict what people were actually doing. This is fallibility: evidence
may give a picture of the facts that does not correspond to the facts.
This complete yet fallible legal system would not incur the problem of
gaps in the evidence, but would still incur the problem of erroneous
decisions. It would still be necessary in this legal system to assess
the strength of evidence. Recordings that show indication of error
should count as weaker evidence in favor of what they depicted than
recordings that did not show any indication of error. So the problem of
gaps in the evidence is not due to the fallibility of the evidence, but
its incompleteness.\footnote{To underscore this point, a third legal
  system could exist, one that was infallible yet incomplete. Any
  recording available would be infallibly accurate, but recordings would
  not always be available about anyone in any place at any time. This
  system, despite relying on infallible evidence, would be plagued by
  the problem of gaps. Whether such a system is conceptually possible is
  questionable. For suppose propositions \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) describe
  distinct facts that are causally related. If there is infallible
  evidence about \(A\) and \(C\), but no infallible evidence about
  \(C\), there would be be fallible evidence about \(B\), namely \(A\)
  (a cause of \(B\)) and \(c\) (an effect of \(B\)). So, in this case,
  incompleteness implies fallibility. A system that was infallible yet
  complete could be a system in which a set of propositions \(\Sigma\)
  was causally independent of others \(\Delta\). Suppose there is
  infallible evidence about all the facts described by the propositions
  in \(\Sigma\), but no evidence whatsoever about the facts described by
  the propositions in \(\Delta\). This would be a system that is both
  infallible (all the evidence that there is infallible), yet incomplete
  (not every fact is represented by an item of evidence). There would be
  no fallible evidence.}

In the world we live in, any system of adjudication will be infallible
(relying on fallible evidence) and incomplete (without access to
evidence about anyone at any time at any time). Fallibility and
incompleteness are intertwined. For one may affect the other. Say the
truth of some complex proposition \(A \wedge B \wedge C\) is under
dispute. There is infallible evidence \(A\) holds and infallible
evidence that \(C\) holds, but no infallible evidence about \(C\).
Suppose that \(A, B\) and \(C\) form a temporally ordered series of
events: \(A\) stands for forming an intention to do \(\varphi\); \(B\)
stands for executing \(\varphi\); and \(C\) stands for bringing about a
consequence of doing \(\varphi\). Since \(A\) and \(C\) are known for
sure, then \(B\) becomes more likely in light of \(A\) and \(C\). In
fact, \(A\) and \(C\) are fallible evidence for \(B\). So, in this case,
the incompleteness of the evidence about \(A, B\) and \(C\) implies the
fallibility of the evidence about \(B\) and \(A \wedge B \wedge C\).

Why could a legal system of adjudication not be complete---that is, fail
to have access to evidence about anyone in any place at any time? There
could be several explanations for this. First, some facts may not be
evidentiable, so to speak. For example, before genetic testing was
invented, the fact that a blood stain carried a genetic profile was not
evidentiable---it could not be translated into evidence. Second, a fact
may be evidentiable, but it was not the target of evidence. For example,
a blood stain was not analyzed or no witness could see what happened
inside the store when the customer tripped and fell. Third, a fact was
evidentiable, it was the target of evidence at some point, but the
evidence could not be retained, it was destroyed or deteriorated
significantly later on. Say a video recording of what happened inside
the store existed, but it was later deleted. Perhaps it was too costly
to keep in storage. Destruction or deterioration of the evidence could
occur as a mere accident or could be done intentional, for example, when
one of the litigants in a trial had an interest in destroying the
evidence. There are of course variations in between these two extremes:
nor was it accident, nor was it intentional but the destruction was due
to someone negligence or failure to follow certain standards. The
destruction may also be mandated by company standards to minimize costs
or by competing interest, such as privacy.

The next question is why we should care about gaps in the evidence. If
there are gaps in the evidence, what is the big deal? Let's assume for
now that the primacy goal of the legal system, of adjudication is making
judgment about people's action that are factually correct, so maximizing
true positives (say convict factually guilty people) and true negatives
(say acquit factually innocent people). This is controversial, but we
will work on this assumption for now. The question now becomes: does the
existence of gaps in the evidence make the legal system less likely to
reach accurate judgments? In a sense, the answer to this question is
obviously positive. Because not every fact is reflected in evidence
accessible to the legal system, there will be criminal acts, frauds,
infringements of rights etc. that go completely undetected. In fact, we
know that most crimes go undetected, and some crimes have particularly
low rates of prosecution. This is unsurprising, but a matter that
pertain institution and social arrangement that are outside the system
of adjudication, such as police investigation. But let's now ask a more
focused question: suppose a defendant stands accused in a civil or
criminal trial. Does the fact that the evidence could be incomplete make
it more likely that an erroneous judgment would be reached, either a
false positive or false negative? The answer, once again, seems
positive, but it is instructive to spell out why exactly. As it turns
out, the answer is not so clear cut.

ADD RATIONLE OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AUTHORITY OF LEGAL SYSTEM.

Suppose that favorable and unfavorable evidence to one of the parties is
always missing for fortuitous reasons---errors in recording,
accidents---as well as occasional bad faith acts of destruction of the
evidence. When this happens, there is no reason to think that a trial
decision would be more prone to make erroneous decisions, false
positives or false negatives. This situation is similar to when random
errors, with no systemic pattern, occurs in data points. Now, of course,
in individual cases, gaps in the evidence will cause errors. If
exculpatory evidence ends up missing and the defendant was actually
innocent, an incorrect guilty verdict could have been avoided had the
evidence not gone missing. Or conversely, if incriminating evidence ends
up missing and the defendant was actually guilty, an incorrect acquittal
would have been avoided had the incriminating evidence not gone missing.
So gaps will be the cause of mistaken verdicts in individual cases.
However, here we are consider the long-term accuracy performance of the
adjudication system. Additional evidence, be incriminating or
exculpatory, could turn a verdict from a correct conviction to an
incorrect acquittals or turn a correct acquittal to an incorrect
conviction. So gaps in the evidence need not be detrimental to accuracy
if they follow a random pattern. In fact, gaps in the decisions may
actually be accuracy-enhancing.

NEED TO CHANGE AND REFINE THAT EXAMPLE BELOW: (I) ASSUME MISSING
EVIDENCE OCCURS IN 40\% OF CASES AT RANDOM, BUT IT ONLY MATTERS IN 20\%
OF CASES--MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR DECISION IN 20\% OF CASES. IN THOSE
20\% OF CASES THAT MISSING EVIDENCE ITSEL IS DECISIVE, EITHER CONFORMS
WHAT THE SMALLER BODY OF EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE SAID OR TURNS THINGS
AROUND. SO IN 20\% OF THE CASES THE SYSTEM'S RELIABILITY IS THE SAME AS
THE MISSING EVIDENCE RELIABILITY. (II) THREE CASES HERE: (II-A) ONE, IF
THE MISSING EVIDENCE RELIABILITY IS LOWER THAN THE THE BODY OF EVIDENCE
(WITHOUT THE ADDED MISSING EVIDENCE), THEN WE HAVE A REDUCTION OF
RELIABILITY OF THE DECISION SYSTEM. (II-B) SECOND, IF THE MISSING
EVIDENCE HAS THE SAME RELIABILITY, WE HAVE NO CHANGE. T(III-C) HIRD, IF
IT IS BETTER, THEN WE HAVE AN IMPROVEMENT. NEITHER OF THESE THREE CASES
IS NECESSARY, SO WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ADING THE MISSING EVIDENCXE
IMPROVES ACCURACY OF TRIAL DECISION MAKING. TO ENSURE THAT ADDING
MISSING EVIDENCE IMPROVES ACCURACY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN
(III-C) ONLY.

This claim can be illustrated with a simple example. Suppose trial
defendants are 25\% factually innocent and 75\% factually guilty. Assume
a body of evidence has been amassed against them. Had they been judged
on the sole evidence available---so evidence with gaps----the false
positives (false convictions) would have been 30\% and the false
negatives (false acquittals) also 30\%. The assumption is that the
system of legal adjudication---with gaps in the evidence---have true
positive and true negative rates of 70\%. Compare this system with
another system that relies on more complete evidence. Suppose the
additional evidence materializes and is accessible at random, say it is
accessible in 20\% of the cases. Crucially, what is random is the
availability of the evidence, not whether the evidence is exculpatory or
incriminating. Suppose that the evidence tracks the facts of guilt and
innocence, as follows: 60\% of guilty defendant will face this
additional evidence as incriminating and 60\% of innocent defendants
will face this evidence as exculpatory. So the additional evidence has a
true positive and true negative rates of 60\%. Assume this evidence
makes a different to the decision, in 20\% of the case in which this
evidence materializes the decision depends on that additional evidence
only. So, while 80\% of defendants will be judged with a false positive
and false negative rates of 30\%, the other 20\% will be judged with
rates of error of 40\%. So overall the error rates of the system with
additional evidence would be worse. If the additional evidence had a
true positive and true negative rates of 70\%, its addition would make
no difference to the long-term accuracy of the system.

So filling gaps in the evidence need not improve accuracy in the
long-run. This holds in the simple example above, and there may be
variations that invalidate this conclusion. The key assumption in the
example is that the additional evidence materialized and was accessible
to system at random. By contrast, the problem of gaps in the evidence
seems precisely that one side or th other might have better accessible
to a full body of evidence than the other side, say for economic
reasons, and then take advantage of this asymmetry. In this sense,
symmetric gaps in the evidence are much less worrisome---if at
all---than symmetric gaps in the evidence. When gaps in the evidence
follow a systemic pattern, they do have a detrimental effect on
accuracy. For suppose wealthy defendants have better access to
additional evidence and would use that evidence whenever it would
benefit their case. This would cause a unilateral reduction of findings
of liability against wealthy defendants. So, a tentative conclusion here
is that gaps in the evidence should be limited when they are asymmetric,
not when they occur simply as a matter fortuitous circumstances.

In light of the above discussion, the final question to ask concerns how
the legal system should respond to gaps in the evidence, what rules (if
any) it should put in place to remedy gaps. We have seen that gaps in
the evidence are not necessarily a bad thing. It is not true, in
general, that gaps in the evidence increase the likelihood that a legal
decision could be erroneous. Now, when rules are put in place to remedy
these gaps, they may serve different purposes, but it would odd that
their purpose would be merely to avoid gaps for teh sake of avoiding
gaps.

\hypertarget{a-case-of-missing-evidence}{%
\section{A Case of Missing Evidence}\label{a-case-of-missing-evidence}}

We start by recounting the facts of a paradigmatic case of missing
evidence. This discussion will then serve to outline, in the next
section, the legal framework for addressing questions of missing
evidence.

In a nutshell, the facts are as follows.\footnote{Details of the case
  are as follows: Decker v. Target Corp, Case No.~1:16-cv-00171-JNP-BCW,
  Filed 10/10/2018} The accident occurred at Target, a chain of
department stores in the United States. The customer slips, falls and
gets injured in a Target store because of a flatbed, possibly left
unattended. The customer suffers serious injury and is transposed to a
hospital. The customer sues Target and seeks to recover damages.
However, video surveillance footage is only preserved in part. The rest
is destroyed. It is impossible to reconstruct exactly what happened
before the incident. Before trial, the plaintiff---the customer bringing
forth the accusation---seeks an adverse inference jury instruction
against Target for failing to preserve the surveillance video. The Court
agrees and instructs the jury they can presume that the cart had been
left unattended.\footnote{The outcome of the jury trial, however, favors

It pays to reconstruct the facts more in detail, using excerpts from a
court ruling on the motion for adverse jury instructions submitted by
the plaintiff.\footnote{Motion available at:
  \url{https://cloudnine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Decker-v.-Target-Corp._2018-10-28-20_38_58-0400.pdf}}
The case is quite complex. The incident occurred on December 26, 2015,
at the Target store located in Riverdale, Utah:

\begin{quote}
Caryl Jean Decker was shopping when she tripped on a flatbed stocking cart and
fell onto the floor, suffering serious injury. Mrs. Decker, bleeding from the head, received medical attention at the scene of the incident. She was transported from Target by ambulance.
\end{quote}

\noindent The incident was recorded in its entirety by Target's
surveillance camera. However, only a short portion of the video was
preserved, just a few seconds depicting the fall. The portions of the
video before and after the incident was erased.

The first question is whether Target should have preserved the video
recording in its entirety. For one thing, plaintiff made a prompt and
explicit request to preserve all relevant portions of the recording one
month after the incident.\footnote{``Exactly one month after the
  incident, on January 26, 2016, the Deckers delivered a letter to
  Target, through counsel, requesting that Target preserve ``all
  pertinent records and electronic records pertaining to {[}the{]}
  incident or that could relate to {[}the{]} incident,'' as well as ``a
  copy of any video surveillance that shows {[}the{]} accident or the
  area of the accident at any time before, during, or after the event.''
  Motion for Findings of Spoliation and for Sanctions (``Motion'')
  Exhibit 6.''} On the other hand, Target's policy was to preserve
recordings for no more than twenty-five days.\footnote{``The unsaved
  portions of the footage were later automatically overwritten by
  Target's system, which only maintains video surveillance footage for
  approximately fifteen to twenty-five days.''} Target could argue---as
it did---that it followed its policy. But the question, as the Court
noted, was whether Target had a duty to preserve a more extended version
of the recording. The Court reasoned that Target knew---or should have
known---that litigation was imminent:

\begin{quote}
 In this case, it is apparent that Target was on notice that litigation was
imminent when Mrs. Decker tripped, fell, and left the Target store in an ambulance on December 26, 2015. Target argues it was not on notice until the Deckers’ demand letter arrived on January 26, 2016; however, that argument is disingenuous. Mrs. Decker fell and an ambulance was called. This was a “guest incident” of the sort that Target’s internal policies note create the “potential for a general liability claim to be brought
against Target.” 
\end{quote}

\noindent  So, even though Target's general policy is to delete videos
after twenty-five days, this policy is overwritten in special
circumstances, for example, when litigation is imminent. In deleting the
relevant portions of the video, Target's violated its own policy
pertaining to imminent litigation. All in all, then, Target should have
preserved the video it deleted.

Another question is whether the missing video recording negatively
prejudiced the plaintiff. Here, too, the answer is affirmative. Because
of the missing video, the plaintiff could not make their case, since
there was hardly any other source of information about what happened
around the cart that day:

\begin{quote}
Due to this deletion, the Deckers do not know who placed the flatbed stocking cart at the location of the incident, how long it was there, or why it was there. The Deckers are not prejudiced by the lack of evidence of who placed the flatbed cart because Target does not contest that it was placed on the floor by one of Target’s own employees. However, the Deckers are prejudiced by the lack of footage that would have documented  whether or not the cart was being “worked” or “attended” by a Target employee.
\end{quote}

\noindent So, the Court established that, first, there was a duty to
preserve the video footage, and second, the missing video created
prejudice against the plaintiff.\footnote{This is the legal doctrine
  followed in the case: ``Spoliation sanctions are proper when `(1) a
  party has a duty to preserve evidence because it knew, or should have
  known, that litigation was imminent, and (2) the adverse party was
  prejudiced by the destruction of the evidence.'\,'' Turner, 563 F.3d
  at 1149 (quoting Burlington Northern \& Santa Fe Ry. Co.~v. Grant ,
  505 F.3d 1013, 1032 (10th Cir. 2007)).} These two points, however, are
not enough to warrant an adverse jury instruction against Target The
adverse instruction is justified provided there was bad faith on the
part of Target.\footnote{``To be entitled to an adverse inference
  instruction, the Deckers must establish that Target acted in bad faith
  in failing to preserve the evidence at issue.''}

Did Target act in bad faith in deleting the relevant portions of the
videos? The issue here is muddled, but the basic rationale the Court
followed is this. First, Target went against its own policy and deleted
relevant video recordings that its own policy would mandate to preserve.
In addition, Target tried to argue that the flatbed was attended by an
employee (which is an issue that cannot be litigated since the relevant
recording was destroyed). More specifically, this is what the Court
wrote:

\begin{quote}
In the footage that remains, there is no evidence of a Target employee working the flatbed cart, nor does the flatbed cart appear to move in the eleven-minute gap between the two clips. A reasonable juror could infer that the cart was unattended. However, in defending against the Deckers’ claims, Target intends to offer evidence that one or more Target employees were working or attending the cart ... the Deckers ... have no way to disprove that evidence."
\end{quote}

\noindent Both considerations---one: Target's violation of its policy;
two: Target's attempt to take advantage of the missing evidence that it
itself caused---suggest bad faith on the part of Target as a
corporation.\footnote{There was no bad faith on the part of the
  individual who deleted the video. The employees who deleted the video
  claim they were not aware of Target's policy pertaining to imminent
  litigation. More specifically, this is the reasoning of the Court more
  in detail: ``First, Target failed to instruct its employees regarding
  Target policy of what footage to preserve. Second, Target employees
  failed to preserve all relevant footage. And third, Target's counsel
  now seeks to take advantage of the evidence that Target failed to
  preserve by arguing that the flatbed cart was attended or worked by
  Target employees during the gap in the video. It is this attempt to
  take advantage of a situation that Target caused that leads the court
  to conclude Target acted in bad faith.''} So the Court granted the
adverse inference jury instruction, specifically:

\begin{quote}
The court will therefore instruct the jury to make the adverse inference that the flatbed cart was unattended for the twenty minutes prior to the accident.
\end{quote}

TO ADD, MENTION OTHER SIMILAR CASES: E.G. SALEM TRIALS

NEXT, TRANSITION TO LEGAL FRAMEWORK

NOTE THAT MISSING EVIDENCE HERE IS CLEARLY DEFINED, IT IS NOT GENERIC,
THERE IS A STORY WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS EVIDENCE IS MISSING. TERMINOLOGY:
MANIFEST GAPS (MISSING VIDEO) VERSUS OPEN-ENDED GAPS (MISSING STATS
ABOUT RELIABILITY). EXPRESSION ``OPEN-ENDED GAPS'' MIGHT SOUND STRANGE.

\hypertarget{legal-framework}{%
\section{Legal Framework}\label{legal-framework}}

The legal framework for dealing with missing evidence is informed by a
number of questions. They pertain to the relevance of the missing
evidence, its prejudicial effects, and the remedies that can be applied.
Considerations about why the evidence is missing are also important.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Q1] Relevance - Is the missing evidence relevant?
\item[Q2] Prejudice - Could the missing evidence make a difference to the decision?
\item[Q3] Remedy - What remedies should be granted to the litigant disadvantaged 
by the missing evidence?
\item[Q4] Explanation - Why is the evidence missing? Was it an accident or  misconduct?
\end{itemize}

The first two questions form a yes/no flowchart. First, if the missing
evidence is not relevant, the question of prejudice does not arise.
Missing evidence is evidence whose content is generally unknown. If its
content were known, the evidence would not be missing (though even this
point can be contested; more soon). So, in order to be relevant, missing
evidence should strengthen or weaken the case of one of the litigants.
Short of that, the evidence could be disregarded. For example, suppose
the defendant is charged with illegal possession of firearm. The police
legally searched the defendant's vehicle and found a firearm in a
backpack. The defendant had no permit. The police does not retain all
the items in the backpack. The defense complains during trial that the
evidence is incomplete: information about the contents of the backpack
is missing. Here it seems that the missing evidence is irrelevant. The
evidence available shows conclusively that the defendant was carrying a
firearm without a permit. The exact content of the backpack does not
make any difference.\footnote{Howard - No.~18-CF-157 District of
  Columbia Court of Appeals Link to case:
  \url{https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5fbb6f1d4653d07a51f93921}}
Of course, some might be wonder, what if the backpack contained
information that showed that someone else placed the firearm in the
defendant's backpack with the intent to getting the defendant's
arrested? The question of relevance---as well as the other
questions---requires a standard by which they should be answered. The
standard here could be that, unless the missing evidence is
\textit{clearly} relevant, the evidence counts as irrelevant. This is
just an illustration. The point here is only that a standard must be set
by which the answer to the question of relevance can be adjudicated.

Suppose the missing evidence is clearly relevant. The missing video
recording in the trip and fall case at the beginning is clearly
relevant. Whatever the content of the recording, it could strengthen the
plaintiff's case or weaken it. But, even if the evidence is relevant, it
can make no difference to the decision. When this is the case, the
missing evidence would raise no question of prejudice. The question of
prejudice arises whenever the missing evidence could have turned a
liability decision into a non-liability decision or the other way
around. Consider both cases. In the trip and fall case, the available
evidence is in equipoise. Thus, based solely on the evidence available,
the case should be resolved in favor of the defendant, a finding of
no-liability. However, suppose the video recording showed that the
customer tripped and fell because of negligence by the shop owner: a
bottled spilled and made the floor wet; the floor was left unattended
for a while with no signs. Then, given the recording, the defendant
would have---or at least, could have reasonably----been found liable.
Prejudice can also work in the other direction. Suppose a witnessed
testified against the shop owner, but a second witness was not called to
testify. Based on the available evidence, the balance of the evidence
tips in favor of the plaintiff. But, the second witness could have given
a different recounting of the facts, more favorable to the shop owner.
Their story could have brought the balance of the evidence in equipoise,
thus recommending a finding of non-liability. Whether the evidence is
prejudicial might itself disputed. Like with the question of relevance,
a standard is needed by which to decide the question of prejudice. The
standard could be along these lines: when interpreted in the light most
favorable to the side that could be prejudiced, would the missing
evidence change the decision according to the governing decision rule?

Once it is clear that the missing evidence is relevant and its absence
prejudicial, the question of which remedy should be applied, if any,
arises. This question offers great latitude. An extreme remedy would be
that this: if there is missing relevant and prejudicial evidence that
goes to the detriment of the accused party, the case should be decided
and thus the accusation is dismissed. This remedy seems excessive: it
will likely create a perverse incentive for defendants to destroy
evidence in their favor. The absence of any relevant evidence that could
be prejudicial for them---in this case, evidence in favor of the
defendant---would be enough to dismiss the accusation. So, instead of
presenting exculpatory evidence that would examined via the process of
cross-examination, defendant would simply choose to destroy that
evidence and that claim they were prejudiced and thus they should win
the case. This arrangement makes little sense. Alternatively, the remedy
could apply only provided the party bringing the accusation was
responsible for destroying the evidence favoring the defendant.

Remedies could also apply at the level of how the evidence is assessed,
not at the level of decisions. So, for example, the remedy could be
this: the part responsible for the missing evidence and that attempted
to benefit from the missing evidence should see their case weakened by
some amount of evidential force (proportionate to the extent to which
the part sought to benefit by causing the gap). There may be many other
possible formulations. For example, in the Target's case the remedy was
an adverse jury instruction to presume a fact obtained, where the
presumed weakened the case of the party that, in bad faith, contributed
to the destruction of the evidence.

Another approach would be to initiate a separate litigation for missing
evidence. This might be more appropriate in criminal then civil cases.
To penalize criminal defendants with an adverse jury instructions
because they destroyed evidence may clash with other well-established
rights defendants have, such as the right to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty. At the same, destruction of incriminating evidence must
be adversely sanctioned. To this end, destruction or tainting of
evidence relevant for criminal litigation can count as a wrongdoing in
itself which can be litigated in a separate trial. This should provide
the right incentive for people not to destroy evidence.

\hypertarget{epistemology-or-policy}{%
\section{Epistemology or policy?}\label{epistemology-or-policy}}

It is clear that remedies about missing evidence---whatever their exact
articulation--cannot be decided without answering the question of why
the evidence in question had gone missing. The question of bad faith
intent seems crucial in formulating the appropriate remedy. After all,
it would seem odd---or even downright immoral---to penalize a party that
would otherwise benefit from the fact that some evidence is missing even
though the party had no responsibility in bringing about the fact of
missing evidence. Instead, it is less objectionable to formulate a
remedy for missing evidence along these lines: if available evidence
cannot settle a factual dispute between litigants and a litigant
destructed relevant evidence with bad faith intent of benefiting from
the destruction, the dispute should be resolved against the litigant;
if, however, the lack of evidence tips the scale in favor of a litigant
who however did not maliciously act to destroy the evidence, the issue
must be resolved in favor of that litigant in accordance to the balance
of the available evidence. Why would justify this rule? Presumably, this
rule would create forward-looking incentives for litigants not to
destroy evidence with the intent of benefiting from the destruction.

But remedies to gaps in the evidence may have a more straightforward
epistemic goal, internal to the logic of evidence evaluation. Why should
the litigant who destroyed the evidence with bad faith intent be
penalized? The following inference is plausible: the missing evidence
that was destroyed would be in favor or against the litigant. It is
unlikely that a litigant would destroy evidence in their favor, and thus
the evidence must have been unfavorable to them. If the evidence was
unfavorable to them and had the evidence not been destroyed, the balance
of the evidence would have tipped against the defendant. Hence, the
dispute must be resolved against the litigant who destroyed the
evidence. This analysis does not justify the remedy to gaps based on any
specific policy objectives. In fact, this analysis simply aims to assess
the evidence conscientiously and draws inference about missing
evidence---its treats missing evidence as another fact that can be used
as information to draw inference about the disputed facts.

So we have two approaches here to conceptualize gaps in the evidence.
One approach sees these remedies as an application to a
conscientiousness assessment of the evidence: that some evidence is
missing becomes itself information (evidence) that helps to draw
inference together with other evidence. This a purely epistemic
approach, internal to the logic of evidence evaluation. The other
approach views gaps in the evidence as a a result of objectionable
out-of-court behavior that must be sanctioned. Call this the policy
approach. The two approaches are not exclusive, but one question is
whether the epistemic approach can cover all cases or the policy
approach is needed. It may be that we cannot draw any inference about
the missing evidence one way or another---say the video is missing
because of an accidental blackout or a glib in the system. Both sides
are disadvantaged by the missing evidence: the shop-owner cannot prove
the were not negligent; the customer cannot prove this case against the
shop. So what is the remedy here? It seems here a matter of policy what
to do. But since there is no obviously culpable behavior responsible for
the missing evidence, maybe the answer is just: do nothing. Here is
another case. The shop-owner only stored the videos for a week and the
lawsuit came right after that week. So against, there seems to be no
culpability; no adverse inference against the shop-owner. But perhaps
the policy remedy could be to rule in favor of the custom to create an
incentive for shop-owner to preserve video recording for longer period
of time or simply create a precedents.

The general question is, what are these policy-driven remedies intended
to achieve? In the case of the epistemic remedies the goal is
clear---evaluate the evidence carefully---but when policy remedies are
introduced, what is their goal? The next section takes a set back back
and looks at the problem of evidential gaps from a more general
perspective. We hope to return to these questions afterwards.

\hypertarget{conjectural-gaps}{%
\section{Conjectural gaps}\label{conjectural-gaps}}

Legal framework only considers cases when we know evidence is missing.
We know something happened and we know evidence went missing. There is a
clear story about the evidence missing. But what if evidence is missing
in a more generic, conjectural sense?

There seems to be two cases here:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Additional of evidence missing fits a clear story and thus we can tell
  that, if that evidence is added, the decision would be overall of a
  better quality, so FP and FN rates would both go down in those kind of
  cases. These are cases considered in the legal framework.
\item
  Additional evidence does not fit a clear story so we only know it
  could be relevant in general, but we cannot whether, once added to the
  body of evidence, it would make it of better or worse quality. This
  seems more like the case below we add evidence that is available in
  20\% and we make the error rates worse in those 20\% of cases. So the
  limitation of the legal framework to those cases seems justified.
\item
  What to say about missing evidence about the reliability of eyewitness
  or some testing procedure? Is it good or bad to have that evidence and
  should there be a missing evidence instruction in those cases? Is it
  more like (1) or (2) above? Think about Bayesian network about
  lighting conditions in the awareness growth paper.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{tentative-general-theory}{%
\section{Tentative general theory}\label{tentative-general-theory}}

Here is a tentative general theory, also based on what is said in the
section below: wherever the missing evidence is the result of an action
that can be ascribed to a biased, patterned systematic removal of the
evidence, then that action must be penalized. If the missing the
evidence is fortuitous or random, then no action is needed.

\hypertarget{paradigmatic-cases}{%
\section{Paradigmatic cases}\label{paradigmatic-cases}}

This section examines a few paradigmatic cases of missing evidence. This
examination also details the complexities associated with missing
evidence and the legal framework in place to deal with missing evidence.
We will draw from civil and criminal trials.

\hypertarget{example-salem-trials}{%
\subsection{Example: Salem Trials}\label{example-salem-trials}}

Summarize facts of the case. Identify missing evidence. Question of
whether there was missing evidence (yes), a justification for the
missing evidence (yes/no), prejudice about missing missing (yes/no). The
peculiarity about this case is that the content of the missing evidence
is relatively clear -- what the witness presumably saw is known --
though the evidence cannot be tested.

\hypertarget{hamers-argument}{%
\subsection{Hamer's argument}\label{hamers-argument}}

\textbf{Hamer's first claim:} New evidence can turn out to be positive
(say incriminating) or negative (exculpatory). Since one cannot know
that in advance, the expected probability based on this added evidence
(which can be positive or negative) is just the probability based on the
current evidence. He proves this claim analytically in the appendix to
his paper.

\begin{quote}
More generally, if the evidence is missing it cannot be known which way it points.
It appears equally possible that the missing evidence would confirm the current factual conclusion as
contradict it. The competing possibilities cancel each other out. There is no warrant for the assumption
that the missing evidence will point one way rather than the other. (p. 139)
\end{quote}

\textbf{Comment:} This claim seems right, but there is one puzzling
thing. In our paper on unanticipated possibilities and Bayesian
networks, we show that---given a certain causal structure of the
Bayesian network (=collider with two upstream nodes incoming into
downstream evidence hypothesis, the added node is upstream)---merely
positing that there could be new information (say we could learn the
witness was unreliable or reliable) would change the initial probability
assessment (without learning about the value of the evidence). This is
not true in other cases in which the Bayesian network has a serial
structure and the added node is downstream and not upstream. So, while
Hamer is right in the most abstract sense, there might be causal
structural features of a case (as captured by a Bayesian network) that
do warrant changing one's probability assessment in virtue of learning
that that could be other evidence (even though you do not know what that
evidence actually is).
