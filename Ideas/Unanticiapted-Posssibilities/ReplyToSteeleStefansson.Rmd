# Introduction

Learning is modeled in the Bayesian framework by the rule of conditionalization. 
This rule posits that the agent's new degree of belief in a proposition $H$ 
after a learning experience $E$ should be the same as the agent's old degree 
of belief in $H$ conditional on $E$. That is, 
\[\ppr{E}{H}=\pr{H \vert E},\]
where $\pr{}$ represents the agent's old degree of belief (before the learning experience $E$) 
and $\ppr{E}{}$ represents the agent's new degree of belief (after the learning experience $E$).

One assumption here is that $E$ is learned with certainty. After the agent learns about $E$, there 
is no longer any doubt about the truth of $E$. This assumption has been the target of extensive discussion.^[As is well-known, Jeffrey's conditionalization relaxes this assumption.] The other assumption---which we will focus on---is that $E$ and $H$ belong to the agent's algebra of propositions.
This algebra models the agent's awareness state, namely the propositions that the agent is aware of and entertains as live possibilities. 

The algebra is fixed once and for all. The learning experience does not modify it. Crucially, even before learning about $E$, the agent already knows the degree of belief in any proposition conditional on $E$. In this model, the agent cannot learn something they have never thought about. This picture forces a great deal of rigidity on the learning process. It commits 
the agent to the specification of their 'total possible future experience' (Howson 1976, The Development of Logical Probability), as though learning was confined to an 'initial prison' (Lakatos, 1968, Changes in the Problem of Inductive Logic).


But, arguably, the learning process is more complex than what conditionalization allows. 
Not only do we learn that some propositions that we were entertaining 
are true or false, but we may also learn new propositions that we did not entertain before.  Or we may entertain new propositions---without necessarily learning that they are true or false---and this change in awareness may in turn change what we already believe. How should this more complex learning process be modeled by Bayesianism? Call this the problem of awareness growth. This problem can perhaps be divided into two parts: (i) how to model \textit{learning} a new proposition not in the initial awareness state of the agent;  (ii) how to model \textit{entertaining} a new proposition not in the initial awareness state of the agent (without yet learning it). We will return to this distinction in due course.

Critics of Bayesianism and sympathizers alike have been discussing the problem of awareness growth under 
different names for quite some time, at least since the eighties. This problem arises in a number 
of different contexts, for example, new scientific theories (Glymour, 1980, Why I am not a Bayesian; Chihara 1987, Some Problems for Bayesian Confirmation Theory; Earmann 1992, Bayes of Bust?), language changes
 and paradigm shifts (Williamson 2003, Bayesianism and Language Change), and theories of induction (Zabell, Predicting the Unpredictable).

Now, of course, the algebra of propositions could in principle be so rich 
to contain anything that could possibly be conceived, expressed, thought of. 
Such an algebra would not need to change at any point in the future. God-like agents could be associated with such rich algebra of propositions, but this is hardly a plausible model of ordinary agents with bounded resources such as ourselves.
A fully comprehensive algebra of propositions cannot be the answer here.

A more promising proposal is Reverse Bayesianism (Karni and Viero, 2015, Probabilistic Sophistication and Reverse Bayesianism; Wenmackers and Romeijn 2016, New Theory About Old Evidence; Bradely 2017, Decision Theory with A Human Face) . The idea  is to model awareness growth as a change in the algebra while ensuring that the probabilities of the propositions shared between the old and new algebra remain fixed under suitable constraints.  

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the initial algebra of propositions and let $\mathcal{F}^+$ the algebra after the agent's awareness has grown.  Both contain the contradictory proposition $\perp$ and tautologous proposition $\top$ and they are closed under disjunction $\vee$, conjunction $\wedge$ and negation $\neg$. For reason that will soon become clear, let's pick out subsets of these algebras which contain only basic propositions, those that do not contain connectives such as negations, conjunctions or disjunctions. Call these subsets $X$ and $X^+$ respectively. Obviously, 
  $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{F}^+$ and $X\subseteq X^+$. 
  
  \textbf{Reverse Bayesianism} posits that the ratio of probabilities for any basic propositions $A$ and $B$ in $X$---the basic propositions shared by the old and new algebra---remain constant through the process of awareness growth:
\[\frac{\pr{A}}{\pr{B}} = \frac{\ppr{+}{A}}{\ppr{+}{B}},\] 
where $\pr{}$ represents the agent's degree of belief before awareness growth 
and $\ppr{+}{}$ represents the agent's degree of belief after awareness growth.

What is the justification for Reverse Bayesianism? Perhaps the best justification is pragmatic. As the awareness of an an agent grows, the agent would prefer not to throw away completely the epistemic work they have done so far. The agent may desire to retain as much of their old assignments of degrees of beliefs as possible. Reverse Bayesianism provides a simple recipe to do that. It also coheres with the conservative spirit of  conditionalization which preserves the old probability distribution conditional on what is learned. <!--- Reverse Bayesianism preserves the old probability distribution conditional on the old awareness state.^[Strictly speaking, this interpretation is what we later call Awareness Rigidity.] Similarly, conditionalization \textbf{SHOW PICTURE BELOW}.--->

Reverse Bayesianism is an elegant theory that manages to cope with a seemingly intractable problem. But, unfortunately, it is not without difficulties. Steele and Stefánsson (2021, Belief Revision for Growing Awareness) argue that Reverse Bayesianism, when suitably formulated, can work in a limited class of cases, what they call \textit{awareness expansion}, but cannot work for \textit{awareness refinement} (more on this distinction later). Their argument rests on a number of ingenious counterexamples. We contend, however, that their counterexamples have limited applicability and thus constitute an overall weak case against Reverse Bayesianism. We provide instead simpler and more straightforward counterexamples that make a stronger case against Reverse Bayesianism. At the same time, we will argue that the distinction between refinement and  expansion that Steele and Stefánsson draw, albeit a good first approximation, is too coarse and should be made more precise. We will show that there are cases of refinement in which Reverse Bayesianism (or at least, a suitable rendering of it) can be made to work. 

Besides engaging with Steele and Stefánsson's line of argument, we sketch a more general strategy to move forward with the problem of awareness growth from a Bayesian perspective. Much of the literature is concerned with a formal, almost algorithmic solution to the problem. We believe that seeking a formal solution is not a promising strategy---and in that we agree with Steele and Stefánsson. At the same time, we think that the awareness of agents grows while holding fixed certain material structural assumptions, based on commonsense, semantic stipulations or causal dependency. To model awareness growth, we need a formalism that can model these material structural assumptions. We sketch how this can done using Bayesian networks. This approach---we think---salvages the spirit of Reverse Bayesianism.


# Counterexamples?

We begin by rehearsing two of the ingenious counterexamples to Reverse Bayesianism 
that Steele and Stefánsson have formulated. The first targets 
cases of awareness expansion:

> \textsc{Friends}: Suppose you happen to see your partner enter your best friend’s house on an evening when your partner had told you she would have to work late. At that point, you become convinced that your partner and best friend are having an affair, as opposed to their being warm friends or mere acquaintances. You discuss your suspicion with another friend of yours, who points out that perhaps they were meeting to plan a surprise party to celebrate your upcoming birthday—a possibility that you had not even entertained. Becoming aware of this possible explanation for your partner’s behaviour makes you doubt that she is having an affair with your friend, relative, for instance, to their being warm friends. (Steele and Stefánsson, 2021, Section 5, Example 2)

\noindent
Why does the scenario \textsc{Friends} conflict with Reverse Bayesianim? Even though Steele and Stefánsson do not provide the details, it pays to be explicit here at the cost of pedantry. 

Initially, the algebra only contains the hypotheses 'my partner and my best friend met to have an affair' (\textit{Affair}) and 'my partner and my best friend met as friends or acquaintances' (\textit{Friends/acquaintances}). The other proposition in the algebra is the evidence at your disposal, that is, the fact that your partner and your best friend met one night secretively and without telling you (\textit{Secretive}). There may be other propositions, but these are the ones to focus on. Hypothesis \textit{Affair} better explains the evidence at your disposal than hypothesis \textit{Friends/acquaintances}. In probabilistic terms, this can be expressed by 
comparing likelihoods:
\[\pr{ \textit{Secretive} \vert \textit{Affair}}> \pr{\textit{Secretive} \vert \textit{Friends/acquaintances}},\]
from which it also follows that \textit{Affair} is more probable than \textit{Friends/acquaintances}
\[\pr{\textit{Affair} \vert  \textit{Secretive} }> \pr{\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert \textit{Secretive}}, \tag{>}\]
so long as the prior probabilities of the two hypotheses are not skewed in one direction.^[If you were initially nearly certain your partner could not possibly have an affair, even the fact they behaved very secretively or lied to you might not affect the probability of the two hypotheses.] 

Next, the algebra changes. A new hypothesis is added which you had not considered before: your partner and your best friends met to plan a surprise party for your upcoming birthday (\textit{Surprise}). This is a game changer. The evidence
\textit{Secretive} now makes  better sense in light of this new hypothesis than the hypothesis \textit{Affair}:
<!--\[\ppr{+}{ \textit{Secretive} \vert \textit{Surprise}}> \ppr{+}{\textit{Secretive} \vert \textit{Friends/acquaintances}}\]--->
\[\ppr{+}{ \textit{Secretive} \vert \textit{Surprise}}> \ppr{+}{\textit{Secretive} \vert \textit{Affair}}.\]
And, this new hypothesis should be more likely than the hypothesis \textit{Affair}:
<!---\[\ppr{+}{ \textit{Surprise} \vert \textit{Secretive}}> \ppr{+}{ \textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert \textit{Secretive} }\]--->
\[\ppr{+}{ \textit{Surprise} \vert \textit{Secretive}}> \ppr{+}{ \textit{Affair} \vert \textit{Secretive}}. \tag{*}\]

So far so good. Reverse Bayesianism is not yet in trouble. Steele and Stefánsson, however, 
conclude that the probability of \textit{Friends/acquaintances} should now exceed that of
\textit{Affair}:^[They write: 'Becoming aware of this possible explanation for your partner’s behaviour makes you doubt that she is having an affair with your friend, relative, for instance, to their being warm friends.']
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{Affair} \vert  \textit{Secretive} } < \ppr{+}{\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert \textit{Secretive}}. \tag{<}\]
Arguably, this holds because \textit{Surprise} implies \textit{Friends/acquaintances}. In order to prepare a surprise party, your partner and best friend have to be at least acquaintances. And given that one implies the other, if \textit{Surprise} is more likely than \textit{Affair} (by $*$), then \textit{Friends/acquaintances} must also be more likely than \textit{Affair}.
And if both ($>$) and ($<$) holds, the ratio of the probabilities of basic propositions is not fixed before and after the episode of awareness growth. This is a violation of Reverse Bayesianism. 

<!---
A lot hinges in this example on how we understand hypothesis \textit{Friends/acquaintances}. For one thing,  In other hand, one might argue that, as awareness grows, the meaning of the hypothesis \textit{Friends/acquaintances} has effectively changed. Initially, this hypothesis did not include the possibility that they would organized a surprise party and then later it came to include this possibilities. Only on the first reading, the example is a genuine counterexample to reverseve Bayesianism. 
--->

But, as Steele and Stefánsson admits, Reverse Bayesianism is not really in trouble here. 
It can still be made to work with a slightly 
different---though quite similar in spirit---condition, called \textbf{Awareness Rigidity}: 
\[\ppr{+}{A \vert T^*}=\pr{A},\]
where $T^*$ corresponds to a proposition that picks out, from the vantage point of the new awareness state, what corresponds to the entire possibility space before the episode of awareness growth. In our running example, the proposition $\neg\textit{Surprise}$ picks out the entire possibility space before the episode of awareness growth. So 
Awareness Rigidity would require that:
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert \neg\textit{Surprise}}=\pr{\textit{Friends/acquaintances}}.\]
 Conditional on $\neg\textit{Surprise}$, it is indeed true that the probability of \textit{Friends/acquaintances} has not changed before and after the episode of awareness growth. And it is also true that \textit{Affair} remains the most likely hypothesis in light of the evidence (again conditional on $\neg\textit{Surprise}$):
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{Affair} \vert  \textit{Secretive} \& \neg\textit{Surprise} } > \ppr{+}{\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert \textit{Secretive} \& \neg\textit{Surprise}}. \tag{$>^+$}\]
Awareness Rigidity is vindicated. Reverse Bayesianism---the spirit of it, not the letter---stands.

This is not the end of the story, however. Steele and Stefánsson offer another counterexample to 
Reverse Bayesianism (which also works against Awareness Rigidity):

  > \textsc{Movies}: Suppose you are deciding whether to see a movie at your local cinema.
You know that the movie's predominant language and genre will affect your viewing
experience. The possible languages you consider are French and German and the
genres you consider are thriller and comedy. But then you realise that, due to your
poor French and German skills, your enjoyment of the movie will also depend on the
level of difficulty of the language. Since it occurs to you that the owner of the cinema is
quite simple-minded, you are, after this realisation, much more confident that the movie
will have low-level language than high-level language. Moreover, since you associate
low-level language with thrillers, this makes you more confident than you were before
that the movie on offer is a thriller as opposed to a comedy. (Steele and Stefánsson, 2021, Section 5, Example 3)

\noindent
Initially, you did not consider language difficulty. The algebra contained the propositions \textit{French} and \textit{German}, as well as \textit{Thriller} and \textit{Comedy}. <!---What you are concerned about is whether your will enjoy the movie or not (\textit{Enjoy Movie}), depending on its language and genre. ---> Then, you realized another variable might be at play, namely the level of difficulty of the language of the movie, \textit{Difficult} and \textit{Easy}. The realization that the owner is simple-minded suggests that the level of linguistic difficulty of the movie will be low. The latter in turn suggests that the movie is more likely a thriller rather than a comedy (perhaps because thrillers are simpler---linguistically---than comedies). So, against Reverse Bayesianism, the scenario \textsc{Movies} violates the condition $\frac{\pr{\textit{Thriller}}}{\pr{\textit{Comedy}}}=\frac{\ppr{+}{\textit{Thriller}}}{\ppr{+}{\textit{Comedy}}}$. 

The counterexample also works against Awareness Rigidity. It is not true that $\pr{\textit{Thriller}}=\ppr{+}{\textit{Thriller} \vert \textit{Thriller}\vee \textit{Comedy}}$.
To see why that is, note that this counterexample is a case of refinement. First, you categorize movies  by just language and genre, and then you add a further category,  level of difficulty. In the scenario \textsc{Friends}, instead, the possibility space grew by adding situations in which your partner and best friends met neither as lovers nor solely as friends.^[The addition of the hypothesis \textit{Surprise} is, however, an ambiguous case. For one thing, \textit{Surprise} is a novel hypothesis that cannot be subsumed under \textit{Friends/acquaintances} or \textit{Affair}. On the other, \textit{Surprise} seems a refinement of \textit{Friends/acquaintances}, since a meeting for planning a surprise is a more specific way to describe a meeting of acquaintances. We will provide a more clear-cur example of expansion later in the paper.]  So if \textsc{Movies} is a case of refinement, the proposition which picks out the entire possibility space should be the same before and after awareness growth, for example, $\textit{Thriller}\vee \textit{Comedy}$.  In cases of awareness growth by refinement, then, Awareness Rigidity mandates that all probability assignments stay the same. 

How strong of a counterexample  is \textsc{Movies}? For the sake of clarity, it can be split into two episodes of awareness growth. In the first, you entertain a 
new variable besides language and genre, namely the language difficulty of the movie. 
In the second episode, you learn something you did consider before, namely that the owner is simple-minded. The first is a case of mere refinement: you simply entertain a new way of categorizing movies. The second is a case of learning: you learn something your did not consider before. The tacit assumption here is that awareness growth is both \textit{entertaining} a new proposition not in the initial awareness state of the agent (without yet learning it) and \textit{learning} a new proposition not in the initial awareness state of the agent. We agree with Steele and Stefánsson that both these phenomena should count as instances of awareness growth. But still, one is left wondering: Is only the second episode necessary for the counterexample to work, while the first episode just gives added context? 

Suppose the counterexample only works in tandem with an episode of learning something new. In that were so,  defenders of Reverse Bayesianism or Awareness Rigidity could still claim their theory applies to a large class of cases. It applies to cases of awareness refinement without learning and also to cases of awareness expansion. For recall that the first putative counterexample about awareness expansion---\textsc{Friends}---did not challenge Reverse Bayesianism insofar as the latter is formulated in terms of its close cousin, Awareness Rigidity. So the force of Steele and 
Stefánsson's counterexamples would be limited.

Or perhaps there is a more straightforward counterexample that only depicts mere refinement without an episode of learning and that still challenges Reverse Bayesianism and Awareness Rigidity? As we shall soon see, the answer to this question is indeed positive. 


<!---
Steele and Stefansson consider the objection that 
this is not a simple case of awareness growth: 

  > It might be argued that our examples are not illustrative of a simple learning event 
  (a simple growth in awareness); rather, our examples illustrate and should be expressed 
  formally as complex learning experiences,where first there is a growth in awareness, and then 
  there is a further learning event ... In this way, one could argue that the awareness-growth 
  aspect of the learning event always satisfies Reverse Bayesianism (the new propositions 
  are in the first instance evidentially irrelevant to the comparison of the old basic propositions). 
  Subsequently, however, there may be a revision of probabilities over some partition of the possibility space
  
We think this is a reasonable objection. Steele and Stefansson dismiss it 
because---they write---'the two-part structure seems ultimately unmotivated. 
The second learning stage is an odd, spontaneous learning event that 
would be hard to rationalise.' This response might be too quick. 
--->





# A simpler counterexample

Steele and Stefánsson's counterexample to reverse Bayesianism for the case of  refinement is rather complex, perhaps unnecessarily so. We now present a simpler one:

>   \textsc{Lighting:} You have evidence that favors a certain hypothesis, say a witness testifies 
they saw the defendant around the crime scene. You give some weight to this evidence. 
In your assessment, that the defendant was seen around the crime scene raises 
the probability that the defendant was actually there. But now you wonder, what if it was dark when the witness saw the defendant? So become a bit more careful and settle on this: if the lighting conditions were good, you should still trust the evidence, but if they were bad, you should not. Unfortunately, you cannot learn about the actual lighting conditions, but the mere realization that it \textit{could} have been dark  makes you change the probability that the defendant was actually there, based on the same eveidence. 

<!---Suppose you do learn that the lighting conditions were bad. In that case, 
the evidence at your disposal should no longer favor the hypothesis that 
the defendant was actually around the crime scene. After your awareness has grown, the probabilty of that hypothesis has gone down.---> 

\noindent
This scenario consists of mere refinement. You wonder about the lighting conditions but you do not learn 
what they were. Still, mere refinement in this scenario challenges Reverse Bayesianism and Awareness Rigidity. The theory of Bayesian networks helps to see why. 

A Bayesian network is a formal model that consists  of a graph accompanied by a probability distribution. The nodes in the graph represent random variables that can take different values. We will use 'nodes'  and 'variables' interchangeably. The nodes are connected by arrows, but no loops are allowed, hence the name direct acyclic graph (DAG). In this framework, awareness growth brings about a change in the graphical network---nodes and arrows are added or erased---as well as a change in the probability distribution from the old to the new network. 

To model the scenario \textsc{Lighting} with Bayesian networks, 
let's start with a simple graph: 
\[H \rightarrow E\]

\noindent
Since you trust the evidence, you think that the evidence is more likely under the hypothesis that the defendant was present at the crime scene than under the alternative hypothesis: 

\[\pr{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present}} > \pr{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent}}\]

\noindent
It is not necessary to fix exact numerical values for these conditional probabilities. The inequality is a qualitative ordering of how plausible the evidence is in light of competing hypotheses. No matter the numbers, by the probability calculus, it follows that the evidence raises the probability of the hypothesis \textit{H=present}:
\[\pr{\textit{H=present}\vert \textit{E=seen}} > \pr{\textit{H=present}}\]

\noindent
Now, as you wonder about the lighting conditions,  the graph should 
be amended:
\[H \rightarrow E \leftarrow L,\]
where the node $L$ can have two values, 
\textit{L=good} and \textit{L=bad}. A plausible way to update your 
assessment of the evidence is as follows:
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=good}} > \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=good}}\]
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{bad}} = \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=bad}}\]

\noindent
This is what you are thinking: if the lighting conditions were good, you should still trust the evidence like you did before. But if the lighting conditions were bad, you should regard the evidence as no better than chance.  Again, there are no exact numerical values here. 

Note the change in the probability function from $\pr{}$ to $\ppr{+}{}$.
The question is, should you now assess the evidence at your disposal---that the 
witness saw the defendant at the crime scene---any differently than you did before?
Would it  be wrong to think the evidence had the same value? The evidence has the same value if the likelihood ratios associated with the evidence relative to the competing hypotheses are the same before and after awareness growth:
\[\frac{\pr{E=e \vert H=h}}{\pr{E=e \vert H=h'}}= \frac{\ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h}}{\ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h'}} \tag{C}.\]
But it would be quite a coincidence if (C) were true. For concreteness, let's use some numbers:
\[\\pr{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present}}=\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=good}}=.8\] 
\[\pr{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent}}=\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=good}}=0.4\]
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=bad}} = \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=bad}}=0.5.\]
So the ratio $\frac{\pr{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present}}}{\pr{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent}}}=2$. Before awareness growth, you thought the evidence favored the hypothesis \textit{H=present} moderately strongly.  That seemed reasonable. But, after the awareness growth, the ratio $\frac{\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present}}}{\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent}}}=\frac{.65}{.45}\approx 1.44$.^[The calculations here rely on the dependency 
structure encoded in the Bayesian network (se starred step below).
\begin{align*}
\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present}} &= \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \wedge \textit{L=good} \vert \textit{H=present}}+\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \wedge \textit{L=bad} \vert \textit{H=present}}\\
&= \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=good}}  \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=good} \vert  \textit{H=present} }\\ & +\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen}  \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=bad}} \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=bad} \vert  \textit{H=present}}\\
&=^* \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=good}}  \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=good}}\\ & +\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen}  \vert \textit{H=present} \wedge \textit{L=bad}} \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=bad}}\\
&= .8 \times .5 +.5 *.5 = .65 
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent}} &= \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \wedge \textit{L=good} \vert \textit{H=absent}}+\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \wedge \textit{L=bad} \vert \textit{H=absent}}\\
&= \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=good}}  \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=good} \vert  \textit{H=absent} }\\ & +\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen}  \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=bad}} \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=bad} \vert  \textit{H=absent}}\\
&=^* \ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=good}}  \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=good}}\\ & +\ppr{+}{\textit{E=seen}  \vert \textit{H=absent} \wedge \textit{L=bad}} \times \ppr{+}{\textit{L=bad}}\\
&= .4 \times .5 +.5 *.5 = .45 
\end{align*}]\todo{Need a more general argument here. Simulation?}
So mere refinement can weaken the evidence, 
even without learning anything new. Of course, if you did learn that the lighting conditions were bad, the evidence would become even weaker, effectively worthless:
\[\frac{\ppr{+, \textit{L=bad}}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=present}}}{\ppr{+, \textit{L=bad}}{\textit{E=seen} \vert \textit{H=absent}}}=1,\]
where $\ppr{+, \textit{L=bad}}{}$ is the new probability function after learning that \textit{L=bad}.

Why does all this matter? After awareness growth, the evidence at your disposal favors \textit{H=defendant-present}  less strongly or not at all. Since the prior probability of the hypothesis should be the same before and after awareness growth, it follows that
\[\ppr{+}{\textit{H=defendant-present} \vert \textit{E=defendant-seen}} \neq \pr{\textit{H=defendant-present} \vert \textit{E=defendant-seen}}\]
<!--\[\ppr{+, \textit{L=bad} }{\textit{H=defendant-present} \vert \textit{E=defendant-seen}} \neq \pr{\textit{H=defendant-present} \vert \textit{E=defendant-seen}}\]--->
This outcome violates Awareness Rigidity. For recall that in cases of refinement, Awareness Rigidity requires that the probability of basic propositions stay fixed. Reverse Bayesianism is also violated. For example, the ratio of the probabilities of \textit{H=defendant-present} to \textit{E=defendant-seen}, before and after awareness growth, has changed:
\[\frac{\ppr{\textit{E=defendant-seen}}{\textit{H=defendant-present}}}{\ppr{ \textit{E=defendant-seen}}{\textit{H=defendant-seen}}} \neq \frac{\ppr{+, \textit{E=defendant-seen}}{\textit{H=defendant-present}}}{\ppr{+, \textit{E=defendant-seen}}{\textit{H=defendant-seen}}},\]
where $\ppr{\textit{E=defendant-seen}}{}$ and $\ppr{+, \textit{E=defendant-seen}}{}$ represent the agent's degrees of belief, before and after awareness growth, updated by the evidence $\textit{E=defendant-seen}$.


# A Modest Conservativity Constraint

So we now have a simpler counterexample that works even without postulating
that mere refinement takes place together with learning something new. 
The scenario \textsc{Lighting} strengthens Steele and Stefánsson's case against 
Reverse Bayesianism and Awareness Rigidity. At the same time, 
this counterexample also show that something can be preserved.

In \textsc{Lighting}, we have seen that probability functions $\pr{}$ and $\ppr{+}{}$ 
do not assign the same weight to the evidence relative 
to the competing hypotheses, except in somewhat exceptional circumstances. 
But despite that, the two probability functions agree in one important respect: 
\[\pr{E=e \vert H=h} \geq \pr{E=e \vert H=h'} \textit{ iff } \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h} \geq \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h'} \tag{$C^*$},\]
where (i) $E$ and $H$ are nodes that are part of the graphical network before and after the awareness growth, and (ii)  there is a direct path from $E$ to $H$ before and after awareness growth.\todo{Is the condition of direct path necessary?} In other words, the plausibility ordering between hypotheses and evidence is preserved. Condition $(C^*)$ is a good candidate for a conversativity constraint that governs the relationship between $\pr{}$ and $\ppr{+}{}$. It is satisfied in the scenario of awareness growth just provided, \textsc{Lighting}.

There may well be cases in which the plausibility ordering is not preserved. This would be a \textit{truly transformative} awareness growth. But this would rarely if ever happen. Even in skeptical cases, the plausibility ordering should be preserved. For suppose you have evidence that---in your judgment---reliably tracks a hypothesis, say you think that evidence as of hands reliably tracks the presence of hands. You now entertain a skeptical hypothesis in which a demon actually switches things around: when you see a hand, there is no hand, and when you do not see a hand, there is actually a hand. Even in this case, there would be no violation of a condition like ($C^*$).

Here is how the proof would work. Assume node $E$ has an incoming arrow from node $H$, before and after awareness growth. Also assume that variables are binaries. We want to show that 
\[\pr{E=e \vert H=h} \geq \pr{E=e \vert H=h'} \textit{ iff } \ppr{+}{E=e \vert X=x} \geq \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h'}.\] 
After awareness growth, besides $E$ and $H$, another variable $Y$ 
is under consideration, also binary. By the law of total probability and the dependency assumptions in the Bayesian network, what we need to show becomes:
\[\pr{E=e \vert H=h} \geq \pr{E=e \vert H=h'}\]
\[\textit{ iff }\] 
\[\ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h \wedge Y=y}\times \ppr{+}{Y=y} + \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h \wedge Y=y'}\times \ppr{+}{Y=y'} \]
\[\geq\]
\[\ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h' \wedge Y=y}\times \ppr{+}{Y=y} + \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h' \wedge Y=y'}\times \ppr{+}{Y=y'} \]
To show that, we rely on an additional assumption:
\[\pr{E=e \vert H=h} \geq \pr{E=e \vert H=h'} \]
\[\textit{ iff }\] 
\[\ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h \wedge Y=y} \geq \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h' \wedge Y=y} \]
\[\textit{ iff }\] 
\[\ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h \wedge Y=y'} \geq \ppr{+}{E=e \vert H=h' \wedge Y=y'}\]
This assumption is crucial. Intuitively, it says that the plausibility ordering remains the same before and after awareness growth \textit{all else being the same}. This is a minimal assumption, and it is enough to establish what we want since $a \geq a'$ and $b\geq b'$ iff $ak \geq a'k$ and $b(1-k)\geq b'(1-k)$ (for $k>0$) iff  $ak+b(1-k) \geq a'k+b'(1-k)$.


The preservation of the plausibility ordering formulated by 
condition ($C^*$) should also hold in Steele and 
Stefánsson's scenario, \textsc{Movies}. 
We now briefly explain why. 

At first, the graphical network looks like this:
\[\textit{Genre} \rightarrow \textit{Enjoyment} \leftarrow \textit{Language},\]
where each node can take two values: \textit{Genre=comedy} and \textit{Genre=thriller};
\textit{Language=french} and \textit{Language=german}; and \textit{Enjoyment=yes} and   \textit{Enjoyment=no}. Assume you have no reason to think the language or genre or the movie is one of the two. But also assume you are ranking the options in terms of how they are going to contribute to your enjoyment (\textit{Enjoyment=yes}).
<!---as follows:
\[\textit{Language=french} \wedge \textit{Genre=comedy}\]
\[\textit{Language=german} \wedge  \textit{Genre=thriller}\]
\[\textit{Language=french} \wedge \textit{Genre=thriller}\]
\[\textit{Language=german} \wedge  \textit{Genre=comedy}\]
--->
You are more likely to enjoy a comedy in French more then everything else, but you are more likely to enjoy a thriller in German than one in French, and your lowest preference is for a comedy in German. This ranking can be encoded, for all combinations, by conditional probabilities of the form 
\[\pr{\textit{Enjoyment=x} \vert \textit{Language=y} \wedge \textit{Genre=z}} \geq \pr{\textit{Enjoyment=x} \vert \textit{Language=y'} \wedge \textit{Genre=z'}}.\]

The first episode of awareness growth consists in realizing 
that the linguistic difficulty of the movie could also be a factor. 
So the expanded graphical network now becomes:
\begin{align*}
\textit{Difficulty} &\\
\downarrow \\
\textit{Genre} \rightarrow \textit{Enjoyment} &\leftarrow \textit{Language}\\
\end{align*}
\noindent
The new node can take two values: \textit{Difficulty=high} and \textit{Difficulty=low}.
Your ranking of what is likely to give you enjoyment should now be updated and made more specific, but much of the earlier ordering can be retained, that is:
\[\pr{\textit{Enjoyment=x} \vert \textit{Language=y} \wedge \textit{Genre=z}} \geq \pr{\textit{Enjoyment=x} \vert \textit{Language=y'} \wedge \textit{Genre=z'}}\] \[\textit{ iff }\] \[\ppr{+}{\textit{Enjoyment=x} \vert \textit{Language=y} \wedge \textit{Genre=z}} \geq \ppr{+}{\textit{Enjoyment=x} \vert \textit{Language=y'} \wedge \textit{Genre=z'}}.\]
The difference between this condition and ($C^*$) is that here two propositions, not just one, are conditioned on. So ($C^*$) can be generalized, as follows. Let $E$ be a node with several incoming arrows departing from a finite set of nodes, $X_1, X_2, \dots X_k$ that are shared before and after awareness growth. Then:
\[\pr{E=x \vert X_1=x_1 \wedge X_2=x_2 \dots X_k=x_k} \geq \pr{E=x \vert X_1=x_1' \wedge X_2=x_2' \dots X_k=x_k'}\] 
\[\textit{ iff }\] 
\[\ppr{+}{E=x \vert X_1=x_1 \wedge X_2=x_2 \dots X_k=x_k} \geq \ppr{+}{E=x \vert X_1=x_1' \wedge X_2=x_2' \dots X_k=x_k'} \tag{$C^{**}$}.\]



# A different refinement 

## Downstream refinement 


Let's return to the previous example. A witness saw that the defendant was around the crime and you take this to be evidence that the witness was actually there. So, as before, the graphical network looks like this:
\[H\rightarrow E\]
Instead of worrying about the lighting conditions, you worry that the witness might be lying or dismembered what happened, etc. Perhaps, they were never there, they made things up or mixed thing up. That is certainly a possibility.  The graphical 
network should be updated:
\[H\rightarrow E \rightarrow R\]
Note the difference between $E$ and $R$. The evidence node bears on what the witness saw. The reporting node bears on what the witness reports to have seen. The chain of transmission from 'seeing' to 'reporting' may fail for various reasons, such as lying or accidental confusion. Whatever the cause, there is an added source of error. 

Even if this is a case of refinement\todo{check that it is under their defintion}, the old and new probability function agree with with another in full. The conditional probabilities, $\pr{E=x \vert H=y}=\ppr{+}{E=x \vert H=y}$ for the nodes shared before and after 
awareness growth.\todo{gove proof of this}

# Expansion


There remains to examine cases of awareness expansion. They consist in the addition of another proposition not previously in the algebra,  but that is 
not a refinement of existing propositions. The addition of the hypothesis \textit{Surprise} is, however, an ambiguous case. For one thing, \textit{Surprise} is a novel hypothesis that cannot be subsumed under \textit{Friends/acquaintances} or \textit{Affair}. On the other, \textit{Surprise} seems a refinement of 
\textit{Friends/acquaintances}, since a meeting for planning a surprise is a more specific way to describe a meeting of acquaintances. A more clear-cut case of awareness expansion would be the following. The police is investigating a murder  case. There are two suspects under investigation: Joe and Sue. They both have a motive. The incriminating evidence favors one over the other, but not overwhelmingly. <!--The evidence consists in a DNA match and information about how the crime was committed.  Sue genetically matches the traces, but  is quite short and the perpetrator is known to be a  tall person. Joe is neither tall nor does he genetically match the crime traces. In light of the evidence, Sue seems more likely the culprit than Joe, but matters are still open ended. --->T hen, a new hypothesis is considered: Ela could be the perpetrator. <!--As it turns out, Ela genetically matches the traces, is tall enough to have committed the crime, and does have a motive. This seems a straightforward case of expansion because Ela, Sue and Joe are incompatible hypotheses, while  \textit{Friends/acquaintances} and  \textit{Surprise} need not be. --->
The evidence incriminates Ela almost without any doubt. Any theory of awareness growth should be able to model the difference between the example provided by Steele and Stefánsson and the criminal case just outlined. They are both, arguably, cases of expansion, but they are also different.  

Steele and Stefánsson provide a formal definition of the difference between refinement and expansion. Our observations here are largely confined at the intuitively level. Our point is that there are a number of intuitively plausible differences that a formal theory should be able to capture. The coarse distinction between refinement and expansion might be, in the end, too coarse. Relying on Bayesian networks, we will illustrate this point more precisely in the next section. 



## Steele and Stefánsson example


Before awareness growth, the Bayesian network has a simple form: \[H \rightarrow E,\] where the hypothesis variable $H$ takes two values, $H=\textit{Affair}$ and $H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances}$.  The evidence variable $E$ can take several values, one of them being $E=\textit{Secretive}$. You could have seen other things other than what you saw, but there is no need to specify the other values exhaustively. Suppose the prior odds ratio of the hypotheses is 1:1, say, because you suspected your partner might be cheating on you, and the likelihood ratio \[\frac{\pr{E=\textit{Secretive}\vert H=\textit{Affair}}}{\pr{E=\textit{Secretive}\vert H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances}}}\] is 9:1, because the
hypothesis \textit{Affair} is a better explanation of the evidence than the hypothesis \textit{Friends/acquaintances}. Then, the posterior probability given the evidence \[\pr{H=\textit{Affair} \vert E=\textit{Secretive}}\] is quite high, $\frac{9}{10}=.9$.
So $\ppr{E=\textit{Secretive}}{H=\textit{Affair}}=.9$.^[This calculation presupposes that the two hypotheses 
\textit{Affair} and \textit{Friends/acquaintances} are exclusive and exhaustive. This assumption is justified given the initial awareness state of the agent.]

After awareness growth, the Bayesian network should be modified as follows:
 \[H \leftarrow H' \rightarrow E,\]
where the new hypothesis node now consists of three values instead of two: 

$H'=\textit{Affair}$ 

$H'=\textit{Friends/acquaintances}\wedge \neg \textit{Surprise}$  

$H'=\textit{Friends/acquaintances}\wedge\textit{Surprise}$. 

\noindent
The scenario $\textit{Friends/acquaintances}$ is split into the scenario in which your partner and best friend met simply as friends or acquaintances, and the scenario in which they met to prepare a surprise party for you. On this interpretation, the counterexample by Steele and Stefánsson is a case of refinement, not expansion. We will return to this point later.

The network contains a directed arrow between the old hypothesis node $H$ and the new hypothesis node $H'$ 
This arrow can be interpreted as a bridge between the old awareness state limited to two hypotheses and the new awareness state that contains an additional hypothesis. This bridge is purely conceptual and can be defined by two sets of constrains. The first set of constrains posits that \textit{Affair} under $H$ has the same meaning as \textit{Affair} under $H'$:

$\ppr{+}{H=\textit{Affair} \vert H'=\textit{Affair}}=1$

$\ppr{+}{H=\textit{Affair} \vert H'=\textit{\textit{Friends/acquaintances}}}=0$

$\ppr{+}{H=\textit{Affair} \vert H'=\textit{Surprise}}=0$

The second set of constrains posits that hypothesis $\textit{Friends/acquaintances}$ under $H$ can be actually be interpreted in two ways under $H'$, as  $\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \wedge \neg \textit{Surprise}$ and  $\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \wedge \textit{Surprise}$. So, in other words, the episode of awareness growth consists in the realization that $\textit{Friends/acquaintances}$ can be made precise in two more specific ways:

$\ppr{+}{H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert H'=\textit{Affair}}=0$

$\ppr{+}{H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert H'=\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \wedge \neg \textit{Surprise}}=1$

$\ppr{+}{H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \vert H'=\textit{Friends/acquaintances} \wedge \textit{Surprise}}=0$

This bridge between $H$ and $H'$ justifies the following conservativity constraint:

\[\frac{\pr{E=\textit{Secretive}\vert H=\textit{Affair}}}{\pr{E=\textit{Secretive}\vert H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances}}} = \frac{\ppr{+}{E=\textit{Secretive}\vert H=\textit{Affair}}}{\ppr{+}{E=\textit{Secretive}\vert H=\textit{Friends/acquaintances}}}=\frac{9}{1} \]
